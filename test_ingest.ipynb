       "\n",
       "  2. Compile and deploy the contract using the Injected Provider environment. The contract includes all the configuration variables for the _Sepolia_ testnet. Make sure your wallet is set to use _Sepolia_. The _constructor_ sets the following parameters:\n",
       "\n",
       "    * The Chainlink Token address for _Sepolia_ by calling the [`setChainlinkToken`](/any-api/api-reference/#setchainlinktoken) function.\n",
       "    * The Oracle contract address for _Sepolia_ by calling the [`setChainlinkOracle`](/any-api/api-reference/#setchainlinkoracle) function.\n",
       "    * The `jobId`: A specific job for the oracle node to run. In this case, you must call a job that is specifically configured to return _ETH_ price against _BTC_ , _USD_ and _EUR_. You can find the job spec for the Chainlink node [here](/chainlink-nodes/job-specs/multi-word-job).\n",
       "  3. Fund your contract with 0.1 LINK. To learn how to send LINK to contracts, read the [Fund Your Contracts](/resources/fund-your-contract) page.\n",
       "\n",
       "  4. Call the `btc`, `usd` , and `eur` functions to confirm that the respective `btc`, `usd` , and `eur` state variables are equal to _zero_.\n",
       "\n",
       "  5. Run the `requestMultipleParameters` function. This builds the `Chainlink.Request` using the correct parameters:\n",
       "\n",
       "    * The `req.add(\"urlBTC\", \"<cryptocompareETHBTCURL>\")` request parameter provides the oracle node with the [url](https://min-api.cryptocompare.com/data/price?fsym=ETH&tsyms=BTC) where to fetch the _ETH-BTC_ price. Same logic for `req.add(\"urlEUR\", \"<cryptocompareETHEURURL>\")` and `req.add(\"urlUSD\", \"<cryptocompareETHUSDURL>\")`.\n",
       "    * THe `req.add('pathBTC', 'BTC')` request parameter tells the oracle node where to fetch the _ETH-BTC_ price in the _json_ response. Same logic for `req.add('pathUSD', 'EUR')` and `req.add('pathEUR', 'USD')`. Because you provide the URLs and paths, the `MultiWordConsumer` in the example can call any public API as long as the URLs and paths are correct.\n",
       "  6. After few seconds, call the `btc`, `usd` , and `eur` functions. You should get a non-zero responses. The job spec for the Chainlink node in this example can be found [here](/chainlink-nodes/job-specs/multi-word-job).\n",
