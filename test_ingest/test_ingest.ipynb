    "Chapter 1:\n",
    "What will this course cover?\n",
    "Chainlink, smart contracts, blockchains, and the entire world of cryptocurrency have been a hot topic of discussion for several years now. Whether it’s companies like EY and Microsoft looking to use smart contracts to improve their business processes, artists and athletes like LaMelo Ball creating their own “NFTs,” or up and coming companies looking to disrupt long-standing establishments such as the insurance industry, Chainlink and smart contracts are working to become the backbone for world-changing applications.\n",

    "\n",
    "Chapter 2:\n",
    "What are Contracts?\n",
    "When you buy an artwork, you sign a contract between you and the artist or seller. This contract provides you with proof of ownership of the artwork. But it is possible to forge it and not follow the agreement. The seller could decide not to send the artwork to you though you already paid for it.\n",
    "Agreements, deals, promises: these are concepts that humans universally have an intuition for across cultures. Maybe you agreed to trade three of your toys for one friend’s rare toy as a child. Perhaps you’ve decided to lend your car to a friend as long as they don’t put more than 100 miles on it and return it with a full tank. You may have even agreed with your health coach not to eat more than 2,500 calories per day.\n",
    "\n",
    "These are all examples of agreements. Agreements can be spoken orally, written down on paper, or even typed in digital documents. The enforcement of such agreements is oftentimes informal and “wishy washy.” Disagreement is handled outside of courts or other formal institutions: a friend who brings back your car with 600 miles on it and an almost empty tank of gas loses your trust. Your health coach will be very disappointed in you if you’ve eaten 5,000 calories a day for the past week. Though factors such as reputation, magnitude, and parties within an agreement can affect its enforcement, there is no guarantee that an agreement will be fulfilled.\n",
    "\n",
    "Contracts are agreements that are enforceable in a court of law. You may have signed a leasing contract to rent an apartment or house. Restaurateurs typically sign contracts with food suppliers to obtain necessary ingredients at a specific price and time no matter what happens in different food markets. You may sign an employment agreement with a company to establish your pay rate and employee benefits. In any form, once these contractual agreements have been made, they are enforced by a court of law. Any clause that is not fulfilled within a contract can be disputed and discussed within the court.\n",
    "\n",
    "Arbitration Court\n",
    "In fact, legal contracts have become so notoriously difficult to enforce more companies have been putting \"arbitration\" clauses in their contracts. This means a private arbitration court is used to uphold the contract rather than a public judicial court. There has been a lot of controversy surrounding arbitration courts. You can read more about the history of arbitration courts in this article by the American Bar Association .\n",
    "\n",
    "Chapter 3:\n",
    "Digital Agreements - What we have Today\n",
    "When you buy an artwork on an online platform, you must agree to the Service Level Agreements. They are usually overly complex and can be challenging to understand. They primarily benefit the platform owner, not the users.\n",
    "Digital agreements have been the most common format of agreements in the past decade. From bank agreements to social media, to Netflix, and crypto exchanges, companies who provide services on the internet typically use digital agreements to detail the exact conditions of the service to be provided. These are called SLAs or Service Level Agreements.\n",
    "\n",
    "What makes a digital agreement different from a regular agreement or contractual agreement? Well they’re like regular agreements….but in a digital format. These agreements can be enforced in a court of law under certain circumstances. However, this doesn’t often happen due to the costs of going to court coupled with the low value these contracts represent for individual consumers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Customers also tend not to read these agreements due to lengthy, complex legalese. Oftentimes digital agreements give consumers very little recourse at all! Due to these reasons, the power of digital agreements is heavily skewed towards the institutions who create them rather than being a fair, equitable agreement between institutions and their consumers. A prime example of this is the Robinhood Gamestop downtime incident.\n",
    "\n",
    "What are the SLAs you have agreed to?\n",
    "Think about any digital services you subscribe to, for example video streaming or banking services. Do you know the terms of the SLAs between you and the service provider? If not, take the time and read over one of them.\n",
    "\n",
    "Chapter 4:\n",
    "Naming a Contract\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we will give our smart contract a name. The classic first programming exercise is called “HelloWorld” but this is Web3 so lets call it “HelloWeb3”. To name a contract, you type the keyword \n",
    "contract\n",
    " followed by the name. You then put a set of curly braces beside it. Here’s an example: \n",
    "\n",
    "contract HelloWeb3{\n",
    "\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "Everything within the curly braces is considered part of the HelloWeb3 smart contract. Try completing the contract on the right with the name “HelloWeb3”.\n",
    "\n",
    "Chapter 5:\n",
    "\n",
    "The Smart Contract Connectivity Problem\n",
    "NFTs are a part of Web 3.0 so why not take truly advantage of this new primitive and make your NFT change depending on some conditions on the outside world? We call these changing NFTs Dynamic NFT or dNFTs. But how will you connect your dynamic NFT to outside data?\n",
    "Blockchains and smart contracts are unaware of any conditions or logic that occur outside of the blockchain itself; they cannot connect to outside resources. This is due to the distributed and deterministic nature of blockchains. All of the distributed nodes (nodes are computers running the blockchain software) in the blockchain must come to a consensus on what the blockchain is and any changes to it. If the blockchain just connected to a data source, the nodes could query the data at different times and get other answers, breaking the ability for the nodes to reach consensus. Even worse, if that data source changed locations or is down, the whole blockchain would break.\n",
    "\n",
    "This means developers can program smart contracts as long as their logic doesn’t require any outside data. This may sound highly limiting, but there is a system in place that sits in between blockchains and the outside world (a concept aptly called “middleware”). This middleware system is called an Oracle. The name Oracle comes from the Greek concept of an Oracle since it needs to determine what is true in outside systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "Centralized Oracles\n",
    "So an Oracle is the type of system you want to make a dNFT but it is important that the entire NFT remains decentralized so your art work can truly live on forever. You'll also want the NFT to be have the most accurate up-to-date data.\n",
    "To create functional smart contracts we need a middleware system called an Oracle, but how will we make this Oracle? Well, we are trying to get price data into our smart contract for NFTs. My friend Jim (trust me, he is good!) is an expert in cryptocurrency prices, and he even has a server set up that we can access for price data. Awesome, we'll make Jim our oracle and he will provide price data to our NFT smart contract.\n",
    "\n",
    "But wait….didn’t all the great properties of smart contracts and blockchains come from their decentralized nature? What if Jim wanted to maliciously send our smart contract bad price data so he could manipulate it in his favor? What if his server goes offline when the NFT needs to update and thus can’t? What if Jim isn’t even malicious but gets hacked by a malicious actor? This single oracle solution isn’t solving much of the oracle problem because it isn’t decentralized, and thus provides a weak link that ruins all of those awesome smart contract properties. You need to trust that Jim, and my word on Jim, that he is a great person and will act in the best interest of everyone. But what if we had a decentralized middleware solution, one where Jim doesn’t control everything (sorry Jim), so we didn’t have to trust him?\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally we are here…...enter Chainlink!\n",
    "\n",
    "Chainlink and Decentralized Oracles\n",
    "Using a Chainlink Decentralized Oracle Network (DON) as the Oracle for your dNFT can give you strong guarantees that your artwork will truly update with the latest, most acurate data and remain decentralized. \n",
    "Smart contracts have special properties and need decentralized oracles to carry out functions. This is where Chainlink comes in. Chainlink is a platform for creating decentralized oracle networks that provide various smart contract services. So using Chainlink, we can create a price oracle that isn’t just Jim but Jim and 30 other of the most trusted and expert crypto price data aggregators out there and make them come to an agreement.\n",
    "\n",
    "Chainlink allows developers to create and customize any type of Decentralized Oracle Network, or DONs, a smart contract might need. Developers can choose which nodes are a part of a network, what type of data each node is looking for, how nodes come to an agreement, when nodes should post updates, and any other computation nodes should perform. Finally, with Chainlink, developers can build smart contracts that can interact with the outside world to preserve the decentralized nature of smart contracts.\n",
    "\n",
    "How Chainlink Works\n",
    "Curious how Chainlink works? Read below! With Chainlink, any type of data the exists can be brought on chain, and the conditions on which that data is delivered can be customized! \n",
    "Chainlink allows developers to build and customize DONs. Chainlink allows DONs to work and assures that node operators are incentivized not to collude or act maliciously.\n",
    "\n",
    "How does Chainlink Work?\n",
    "Developers can customize several main areas of Chainlink DONs. These include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Specifying what data DONs need to provide\n",
    "- How DONs retrieve data \n",
    "- When DONs provide data\n",
    "-How agreement (also known as consensus) is achieved among the nodes to achieve a single source of truth for the specified data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each step is outlined in more detail below:\n",
    "Specifying what data DONs need to provide\n",
    "Due to the proliferation of Decentralized Finance (DeFi), a popular use case of Chainlink DONs is relating them with price data. However, any type of data that is available in a digital format can be accessed. This includes but is not limited to weather data, YouTube views, sensor data, or even data from other blockchains. For the NFT we’re just going to stick to price data for now, specifically the ETH/USD price, but you can imagine all the possibilities of cool smart contracts we can make with all of the digital data available today!\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "When DONS Provide Data\n",
    "Some applications require a DON that updates the data once a day. Others need updates once every five minutes or only when the data itself changes by a certain amount. The term heartbeat is used to describe the max amount of time that can elapse before a DON updates it's data feed The term deviation threshold is used to describe how much variation is allowed in the data before it is posted on-chain, regardless of how much time has elasped. For example, if the ETH/USD deviation threshold is set to 1%, then the DON will update the data feed if it senses the price of ETH versus USD fluctuates more than 1%.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "How DONs Provide Data\n",
    "Ideally, nodes should retrieve data from multiple sources and aggregate, or combine, the data to return the most accurate price they can. Developers can use external adapters to customize the sources that nodes use to aggregate data. External adapters are custom built software packages that can be added to the nodes. These can be built in any programming language and perform any operations developers may find useful. These operations can be as simple as basic arithmetic but can span to being complex machine learning algorithms.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "How Consensus is Reached Among Nodes\n",
    "All of the different nodes in the DON have their own version of the price. Using this information, developers customize the aggregation method of Chainlink DONs to determine one value for the true price. This is another level of aggregation beyond the aggregation completed at the individual node level. Having multiple levels of aggregation ensures the highest level of data quality. This aggregation method can consist of any type of operation including median, mean, weighted mean, mode, or other calculations. In our dynamic NFT will make use of a data feed that takes the median of all the node’s price data, since the median is more resistant to outliers than the mean.\n",
    "\n",
    "Chapter 6:\n",
    "Chainlink Data Feeds\n",

    "As discussed in the previous lesson, Chainlink gives developers the ability to create extremely powerful DON’s that provide smart contracts with the highest quality data from outside the blockchain. As a smart contract developer, how can you take advantage of these DONs in your own smart contracts?

    "Solidity\n",
    "Inspired by the power of smart contracts and blockchain, it’s time to dive in.\n",
    "In Chainlink 101, we discussed how and why Smart Contracts are revolutionizing the nature of agreements, and the Internet. But how do we write smart contracts? Well, smart contracts are programmed, and while there are now several smart contract programming languages, the most popular language today is Solidity. Ethereum developers created Soldity from the ground up to work with Ethereum, the first major smart contract blockchain! This is a major reason why contracts written in Solidity have become so prominent. If you are familiar with some programming, it may help to know that Solidity is an object-oriented programming language. If you are not familiar with what that means, don’t worry, we’ll cover it in a future course.\n",
    "\n",
    "Throughout this course, we will learn the basics of Solidity syntax and then apply it to some activities. The best way to learn to program is to program! With that said, let's dive right in!\n",
    "\n",
    "Chapter 2:\n",
    "EVM Intro\n",
    "Having a basic understanding of what’s going on under the hood in Solidity is important so let’s learn about the EVM!\n",
    "Not so quick! I know you are ready to learn Solidity, but there is one other important subject you should know before moving on: the Ethereum Virtual Machine or EVM. The EVM is what reads your code when it is deployed to a blockchain. When Solidity code is compiled, it is turned into EVM bytecode. EVM bytecode is commands that the EVM can read and act on. When a smart contract is deployed to Ethereum, its bytecode lives there forever; always accessible. Any language other than Solidity that can compile to EVM bytecode can also be used to write smart contracts on blockchains that utilize the EVM. Another language that compiles to EVM bytecode is Vyper. Examples of blockchains that run the EVM are Ethereum, Polygon, and Avalanche (among many others). Many blockchains now use the EVM making Solidity an even more powerful smart contract language! \n",
    "\n",
    "Some blockchains have virtual machines other than the EVM and thus have different programming languages and bytecode compilation targets, but for this course, we’ll stick with Solidity and the EVM.\n",

    "Chapter 3:\n",
    "Pragma Solidity\n",
    "Now let's dive into programming in Solidity!\n",
    "One of the first things you will write for any Solidity is the pragma statement. The pragma tells the solidity compiler what version of Solidity you are writing. It typically looks something like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "pragma solidity ^0.8.7;\n",
    "This says we are writing our code in Solidity, and the\n",
    "\n",
    "^\n",
    "followed by\n",
    "\n",
    "0.8.7;\n",
    "means that we will not allow the compiler to compile to a version earlier than 0.8.7 and must compile to a version earlier than 0.9.0.\n",
    "\n",
    "The semi-colon\n",
    ";\n",
    "\n",
    "means we are finished writing that line. Whenever a line of logic is complete in Solidity, it must be followed with a semi-colon.\n",

    "Chapter 4:\n",
    "Naming a Contract\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we will give our smart contract a name. The classic first programming exercise is called “HelloWorld” but this is Web3 so lets call it “HelloWeb3”. To name a contract, you type the keyword \n",
    "contract\n",
    " followed by the name. You then put a set of curly braces beside it. Here’s an example: \n",
    "\n",
    "contract HelloWeb3{\n",

    "Contract State, Variables and Data Types\n",
    "\n",
    "Programs, in very broad terms, do two things: store data and change data. We store data in programs by utilizing variables and change data by defining logic in functions. In smart contracts, when we define variables outside of a function they can be used to store data for that contract, to be accessed at a later time. When defining a variable, you must give it a name and type. You can name the variable whatever you want, as long as it isn’t used more than once. The variable type describes what kind of data were are storing. Is it an integer to do math on? Is it simply a yes or no (1 or 0)? Is just a sentence meant to be read? Some important data types in Solidity are:\n",
    "\n",
    "int: Integers (...-3,-2,-1,0,1,2,3…)\n",
    "  \n",
    "These are whole numbers and can be negative.\n",
    "uint: Unsigned Integers (0,1,2,3…) \n",
    "  \n",
    "These are whole numbers and must be positive.\n",
    "string: Strings (“Hello my name is Glados. The cake is a lie. I like the number 17”)\n",
    "  \n",
    "These are phrases that meant to be read. You can store numbers in a string but you can’t do math on those numbers.\n",
    "bool: Booleans (0 or 1)\n",
    "  \n",
    "A boolean is a variable that can only be 0 or 1. You can also think of these as false (0) and true (1).\n",
    "address: An Account Address (0xa345643f1….e13)\n",
    "  \n",
    "An address represents an accout on Ethereum as a hexadecimal number beginning with 0x. These can be wallet accounts (also known as Externally Owned Accounts or EOAs) or contract accounts (the address where contracts can be found on the blockchain).\n",
    "There are more but we can learn more about them later, these are the major ones for now! Once a variable is assigned a type, it’s type can’t change.\n",
    "\n",
    "An example variable declaration would be: \n",
    "\n",
    "uint myFavNum;\n",
    "This creates a variable called “myFavNum” and assigns it the type uint, or unsigned integer. Now we can use myFavoriteNumber to store numbers like 0,1,2,3,4…etc. in our contract.\n",
    "\n",
    "Chapter 6:\n",
    "Assigning Variables Values\n",
    "\n",
    "In the last activity we created a variable called “myFavoriteNumber” of type uint, but what if we want to actually store a value in that variable? That’s what the equal sign ( = ) “assignment” operator is for. In programming an operator is a symbol that represents an action or process. In the case of the assignment operator whatever is to the left of the equals sign is being assigned the value of whatever is on the right of the equal sign. For instance if we had:\n",
    "\n",
    "uint myFavNum; \n",
    "myFavNum = 42;\n",
    "In the first line we are creating the variable “myFavoriteNum” of type uint, and then in the second line we are assigning “myFavoriteNum” the value 42. So my “myFavNum” will stay 42 until we change it again! Also reminder we put a semi-colon at the end of every complete line. Another example:\n",
    "\n",
    "uint myFavNum; \n",
    "myFavNum = 42; \n",
    "myFavNum = 7;\n",
    "In the first line we are creating the variable “myFavoriteNum” of type uint, and then in the second line we are assigning “myFavoriteNum” the value 42. Then in the third line we are now assigning “myFavoriteNum” the value 7 which overwrites the previous value.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can declare a variable and assign it a value all in one line like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "uint myFavNum = 42;\n",
    "Finally to assign a value to a variable of type string you must put the value in quotation marks (they can be either double or single quotes). For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "string favPhrase = “We live in a society”;\n",
    "\n",
    "Chapter 7:\n",
    "Access Modifiers\n",
    "\n",
    "We can actually give more information to the Solidity compiler on how we want to use our variables (and later functions). We can tell the compiler how we want our variables to be accessed. Many blockchains, such as Ethereum, act as one monolithic computer. While Ethereum is a network of computers distributed around the world, when you deploy code to a blockchain like Ethereum, that code can access any other code anyone has deployed to that blockchain. This is like how programs downloaded to your computer can access other programs on your computer. This allows smart contracts to interact in many unique and interesting ways that regular web application back ends may not be able to do so easily. However, this can also open risks of other code using our code in unintended ways.\n",
    "\n",
    "To help prevent this we can declare “access modifiers” when declaring our variables, which limit what code on the blockchain can access and change those variables. The four types of variable access modifiers are:\n",
    "\n",
    "Public \n",
    "  \n",
    "The variable/function can be accessed or changed by any other code or wallet on the blockchain.\n",
    "Private\n",
    "  \n",
    "The variable/function can only be accessed or changed within the current contract\n",
    "Internal\n",
    "  \n",
    "The variable/function can only be accessed or changed within the current contract or any other contract that inherits the current contract (we’ll discuss inheritance in another lesson)\n",
    "External\n",
    "  \n",
    "The variable/function can only be accessed/changed from outside code or blockchain wallets\n",
    "To declare the access modifier of a variable we put it inbetween the function type and name like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "uint public myFavNum;\n",
    "If no access modifier is declared then the variable is automatically assigned the private modifier. For example\n",
    "\n",
    "uint myFavNum;\n",
    " \n",
    "Is equivalent to \n",
    "\n",
    "uint private myFavNum;\n",
    "\n",
    "Chapter 8:\n",
    "Creating Arrays\n",
    "\n",
    "It is common in programming to want to store many associated values together. For instance I may want to store the title of every book I own. We could put each book title in it’s own variable of type string, but it would be difficult to access all those variables at once, and keep track of each variable when I need to read this information. So instead we can store the book titles in an array of type string. What is an array? It’s many related pieces of data stored together in a single variable!\n",
    "\n",
    "Just like regular variables arrays can only store one type of data, but can have multiple values of that type stored within it. To declare a variable as an array, we put square brackets next to the type of the variable. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "string[] myBooks;\n",
    "Creates a variable called “myBooks” which is an array of strings.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can then assign multiple values to the array by using the assignment operator. The difference from a regular variable assignment is that on the right side of the assignment operator you put the values you want in-between square brackets and separate each value by a comma for example:\n",
    "string[] myBooks = [ “Mastering Ethereum”, “Programming Rust”, “Zombie Survival Guide”]\n",
    "\n",
    "Or \n",
    "\n",
    "uint[] numbers;\n",
    "numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 0]\n",
    "You can limit the amount of values that can go into the array by putting a number in the brackets by the array type when you declare it. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "uint[6] numbers;\n",
    "Limits the amount of values that can fit into the array called “numbers” to a max of 6 values.\n",
    "\n",
    "Chapter 9:\n",
    "Reading Array Values\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we can store multiple related values into a single array our lives organizing our data should be much easier! But how do we access those stored values later? Data stored in arrays is associated with an index which describes the order of the data. Indexing in Solidity starts at 0. So this means the first values assigned to an array has the index of 0, the second value assigned to the array has an index of 1, the third value an index of 2 and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can access the values in an array by calling the array variable and putting the index of the value you want to access within square brackets. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "string[] myBooks = [ “Mastering Ethereum”, “Programming Rust”, “Zombie Survival Guide”]\n",
    "And then\n",
    "\n",
    "myBooks[0] will access the first value assigned to the myBooks array (since Solidity indexes at 0) which will be the value “Mastering Ethereum”.\n",
    "\n",
    "As another example I could take a value in an array and also assign it to another variable:\n",
    "\n",
    "string myFirstBook = myBooks[0];\n",
    "Which will take the value indexed at zero in the “myBooks” array (which is “Mastering Ethereum”) and assign it to the string named “myFirstBook”. This won’t erase it from the myBooks array but make a copy and assign to the new “myFirstBook” variable.\n",

    "EVM: State Machine and Turing Completeness\n",
    "Ethereum is often described as a distributed state machine that is quasi Turing complete. Sounds complicated, right? Let's break it down and understand what it means.\n",
    "A state machine is a system with a finite number of states and a finite number of transitions between those states. A state is a condition that the system is in. Let's assume you have two boolean variables, x and y. Let’s also assume these variables are set to x is true and y is false. This is our current state.\n",
    "A transition is a way to move from one state to another. We can think of a transition as a set of rules that must be followed to perform a change. In our example, x and y can only be set to true or false. So we have 2^2 = 4 possible states. We can move from one state to another based on the input triggering the transition. And everyone with the same input and state would come to the same conclusion and new state. This is called a finite state machine.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now let's apply this to Ethereum. Let's imagine Alice has 4 ETH and Bob has 1 ETH. We can imagine their account balance as variables stored in the Ethereum blockchain. This is our current state. Now Alice wants to send Bob 1 ETH. This is our desired new state. To perform this transition, one must follow explicit rules to perform the change. Transaction verification is beyond the scope of this chapter. But the main point is to understand that the verification is performed to enable the transition to the new state. If the verification was successful, Alice has 3 ETH and Bob has 2 ETH. This is our new state. And everyone can repeat this transition by looking at the previous state and applying the pre-defined transition rules.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ethereum provides the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) to allow custom implementation of transition rules (see Solidity101, chapter 1). So we can use Smart Contracts to model the state of the system. But there is an important limitation here. EVM is just quasi Turing Complete. Let’s understand what this means.\n",
    "\n",
    "A Turing Complete system can solve any computational problem. A problem can be as simple as adding two numbers together. Or it can be as complex as calculating an optimal route between two points on a map. Ethereum could be considered Turing Complete because it can execute any program a Turing machine can run. But Ethereum has some unique properties that make it just quasi Turing Complete. Because blocks have a finite memory space, executing a program that is too large to fit in memory is impossible. This is the first limitation.\n",
    "The second limitation is that Ethereum is a decentralized world computer that must always be online. So it must be ensured that a program is not running forever. As there is no algorithm to determine if a program would halt and not run into an infinite loop (known as the halting problem), Ethereum uses gas to limit the number of computations that can be performed. So every instruction is executed with a cost. It provides a practical solution to the halting problem. Otherwise, bad actors could spam the network and cause a denial of service.\n",
    "\n",
    "Chapter 2:\n",
    "Storage\n",
    "When someone says the data is stored on the blockchain, what does it actually mean from a perspective of a smart contract? Where is the data stored? How is it stored?\n",
    "As we learned in the previous chapter, Ethereum could be described as a state machine. Transactions are then used to transition from one state to another state. The transactions are stored into individual blocks. These blocks are linked to each other creating the Ethereum blockchain. Everyone can take these transactions and follow the transition rules resulting in the same state for everyone.\n",
    "But how can someone read data from the blockchain within a smart contract? And how can we add new (custom) data to the blockchain?\n",
    "\n",
    "We can use the EVM for this and we program the EVM using Solidity (see solidity101, chapter 2 for more details). Solidity offers us three different locations to store our variables. As block size is limited in Ethereum, every bit counts and we should know how these different ways of storing data affect storage capacity. Variables can be declared as storage, memory or calldata to specify the location of the data. In this course, we will only focus on storage and memory. Calldata and the stack will be covered in a future course.\n",
    "\n",
    "Storage variables are also known as state variables. These variables are mutable though their location is persistent. This means that data will persist between function calls. As block space is very valuable, storage variables are arranged in a compact way into storage slots into blocks of 32 bytes. Variables that take less than 32 bytes are combined into the same slot. Taking the least amount of space. Data is stored in order of the declaration in the contract in successive order. So we have slot 0x0, slot 0x1, slot 0x2, and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "STEP 3\n",
    "\n",
    "contract StorageExample {\n",
    "    uint256 nubmerOne = 1; // slot 0x0\n",

    "    bool active; // slot 0x3\n",
    "    bool admin; // slot 0x3\n",
    "    bytes16 foo; // slot 0x3\n",
    "\n",
    "As you can see here, numberOne, customGreeting and numberTwo each take a full slot as they cannot be combined to consume less space. And constant variables (greeting) are not stored in storage slots. When a constant state variable is read the EVM uses the assigned value instead. the booleans active and admin just take 1 bit each and bytes16 takes 16 bits, so a total of 18 bits. That’s why they are all stored in slot 0x3. The last bytes16 variables bar takes another 16 bits but cannot be stored in slot 0x3 because the max size is 32 bytes. So a new slot is occupied.\n",
    "\n",
    "Dynamic-sized arrays and structs are handled a little differently though as the size is unknown at the point of declaration. They always start with a slot that takes 32 bytes and their elements are stored in a different storage slot. The beginning of this storage slot is computed using a Keccack-256 hash.\n",
    "\n",
    "Memory variables live only in memory and exist in the scope of a function. They are mutable inside that scope but cannot be called outside of the function. Once a function execution is completed, all variables in memory are released.\n",

    "Any manipulations done to memory variables is not written into the blockchain resulting in less gas consumption. So this is why we always need to ask if we need persistence.\n",
    "\n",

    "Chapter 3:\n",
    "Mappings\n",
    "Mappings are used to create key-value maps. The key can be any built-in value type like bytes, address or string. The value can be any type including another mapping and array. Mappings are not iterable, so you must know the key to retrieve the value. They are often used to associate an Ethereum address with a value. Mappings can be confusing initially, so let’s focus on understanding the code here.\n",
    "\n",
    "You must define mapping using the following syntax: mapping(key => value) \n",
    "\n",
    "Now let’s assume that we want to assign an address a value. We would write it like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "mapping(address => uint) public amount;\n",
    "So we have a key of the data type address associated with a value of data type uint. And we give this mapping the variable name balances. Next, we will write a simple set function to add a value to this variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "function set(address _address, uint _value) public {\n",
    "  amount[_address] = _value;\n",
    "}\n",
    "This function allows someone to set a positive integer as a value for the provided address. It’s that simple!\n",
    "\n",
    "We do not need to write a custom get function as Solidity automatically provides us with a getter function. But this is how such a getter function would look like so that you can better understand how to read values from a mapping:\n",
    "\n",
    "function get(address _address) public view returns (uint) {\n",
    "  return amount[_address];\n",
    "}\n",
    "So, the syntax looks similar to accessing a value from an array. But what happens when we provide an address that does not exist in the mapping? Solidity will simply return the default value which is 0. So it will not throw an error.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is also how we can delete values from a mapping. We can simply set it to the default value. Solidity offers us the delete keyword to do this properly.\n",
    "\n",
    "function remove(address _address) public {\n",
    "  delete amount[_address];\n",
    "}\n",
    "Now can further complicate this as we can also use other mappings as a value resulting in nested mappings.\n",
    "\n",
    "mapping(address => mapping(uint => bool)) public nestedMapping;\n",
    "This can be confusing when reading for the first time. So let’s try to understand better what we can see here. We have an address (our key) that points to another mapping (our value). This other mapping uses a uint (our key) to point to a boolean (our value). We can imagine a mapping like boxes with labels and inside you have a value. For nested mappings, we have boxes with labels (the addresses); inside each box, there are more little boxes using a uint as a label. If we open one of them, we will find a boolean.\n",
    "\n",
    "To set the value of a nested array, we must provide the address and the uint which works like an index.\n",
    "\n",
    "function set(address _address, uint _index, bool _foo) public {\n",

    "Conditional statements and loops\n",
    "While we are now familiar with storage and basic data types in Solidity, we still have to learn about flow control. We will often run into situations where we need to decide the next step based on the value of a variable. This is where we can use conditional statements. The syntax is very similar to languages like JavaScript. Let’s have a look:\n",
    "\n",
    "function foo(int x) public pure returns (uint) {\n",
    " if (x < 5) {\n",
    "   return 0;\n",
    " } else if (x < 10) {\n",
    "   return 1;\n",
    " } else {\n",
    "   return 2;\n",
    " }\n",
    "}\n",
    "As you can see, this allows us to execute different codes based on if a condition is met. If we do not have an else if case but a simple if/else case, Solidity also supports the ternary operator.\n",
    "\n",
    "function bar(uint x) public pure returns (uint) {\n",
    "  return x < 5 ? 0 : 1;\n",
    "}\n",
    "The question mark ? is called the ternary operator (learn more about operators in chapter 10). The expression means if x is smaller than 5 then return 0 otherwise return 1. We can also use these conditional statements to assign values to a variable:\n",
    "\n",
    "function bar(uint x) public pure returns (uint) {\n",
    "  uint conditionalResult = x < 5 ? 0 : 1;\n",
    "  return conditionalResult;\n",
    "}\n",
    "Here we are using the ternary expression to assign the value to the local variable called conditionalResult.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, to flow control, we often encounter a situation where repetition is needed. Loops are useful when we must repeat a block of code several times. Solidity offers two types of loops. For Loops and While Loops.\n",
    "\n",
    "function forLoopExample() public returns (uint) {\n",
    "  uint counter = 0;\n",
    "  for (uint i = 0; i < 4; i++) {\n",

    "  }\n",
    "\n",
    "return counter;\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "As in JavaScript, we have the same syntax for the for loop: (initialization; condition; increment). The condition is an expression checked at the end of each loop cycle. You can also see that we are using the keywords continue and break here. They allow us to control the flow inside the loop. If a particular condition is met, we can skip the rest of the loop by using continue. So everything that would be executed after continue will be ignored. We can also completely exit the loop by using break. This is useful when we are looking for a specific condition to be met and do not need to run the loop anymore.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next to the for loop, we also have a while loop that can be used. It is similar to the for loop that it has a condition that is tested each time the loop repeats. But the variable declaration is happening outside the loop header and incrementation is happening inside the loop body. One must be very careful not to forget to increment the index to meet the defined condition, or the loop may run forever.\n",
    "\n",

    "Always ensure you do not create a situation where your contract might get stuck when using loops. Imagine you have a dynamic array in storage that will grow over time as new values are added to it and some function is using a loop to iterate through the full array. You might run into a situation where loop iteration will hit the block's gas limit. This would result in an error and make it impossible for that function to complete that loop except you can somehow reduce the array size. So always take care when updating storage values in a loop!\n",
    "\n",
    "You might think that for view and pure functions, you do not have to worry about this aspect, as nothing is added to a block and the state is read from the blockchain.

    "Function Modifiers\n",
    "Now that we have learned how to execute code based on given conditions and our contracts grow in complexity, we will find ourselves in situations where we need to run some checks before we allow the execution of a function. Introducing function modifiers. Modifiers can be run before and/or after function calls. They can be used for example to restrict access or validate input.\n",

    "Modifiers are defined using the modifier keyword followed by a function name. In the body of the function, we can run any Solidity code. Usually, we want to do some checks and if they are not met, we want to revert the transaction. If everything is alright, we can use the special keyword _ to tell solidity to execute the called function. Once the function has finished, we could execute further code inside the modifier to do further checks before the transaction completes. In this example, if someone calls the inc function, it must be the contract owner and we do not allow x to be greater than 42.\n",
    "\n",

    "Chapter 6:\n",
    "Errors\n",
    "In the previous chapter, we learned about function modifiers. We already used the keyword require to check for conditions. If a condition is not met, an error is raised. An error will revert all changes made to the state during a transaction. There are three different ways to throw an error: require, revert and assert.\n",
    "\n",
    "We use require if we want to validate user input and return values from calls to other functions. The syntax asks for a condition and a custom error message as the second argument. If the condition is not met, an error is raised. Otherwise, the next line will be executed.\n",
    "\n",
    "require(x <= 42, \"x must be smaller or equal to 42.\");\n",
    "Revert is used in a similar fashion but directly throws an error without checking a condition. It is useful when the condition check is more complex and you do not want to do it in a single line to improve readability or if several conditions have to be met that you want to check one by one. It will return all remaining gas to the caller. You can call it like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "if (x <= 42 && x > 0) {\n",
    "  revert(\"x must be greater than 0 and smaller or equal to 42\");\n",
    "}\n",
    "Assert is used for internal logic and checks code that should never be false. If an assertion fails, it’s likely that there is a bug in the contract. We can use asserts to ensure that even if there is a bug, we can simply catch it here and make it more difficult to abuse the bug. For example, it is often used to check for overflow/underflow. The following code shows how can ensure that a is always bigger or equal to b so that we do not run into a situation causing an underflow.\n",

    "uint c = a - b \n",
    "assert(a >= b);\n",

    "Chapter 7:\n",
    "Events\n",
    "When learning a new language, we often write a hello world program and log a string to the console. Solidity does not offer a console.log but has events that can be used in a similar fashion. You can use it to emit events that clients can listen to react accordingly. They can also be used as a cheap form of storage as it is less expensive to emit an event than to use the storage location (see chapter 2). But note that events are write-only. EVM does not allow to read events.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s learn how we can use events in Solidity:\n",
    "\n",
    "contract Event {\n",
    " event Log(address indexed sender, string message);\n",
    "\n",
    " function foo() public {\n",
    "       emit Log(msg.sender, \"Hello World!\");\n",
    "       emit Log(msg.sender, \"Another message\");\n",
    " }\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "On the top we have defined a name of the Event and defined it’s parameters. You can see here that we have indexed and not index parameters. Indexed parameters are called “topics” and are searchable parameters in events. We will explain why this is useful in a moment.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can now use the keyword emit followed by the event name Log to emit an event of the type Log. These events can be read on an explorer like Etherscan. And there you will see that each event has the address of the contract or account the event is emitted from and Topics which is the indexed parameter of the event and the data itself. These are ABI-Encoded or hashed non-indexed parameters of the event. More on ABI in a future course.\n",
    "Libraries like ethers.js allow us to listen to these events and react accordingly. The great thing about events is that applications not interested in writing or interacting with the blockchain can still react to events emitted from smart contracts. In other terms, you could consider events a simple way to communicate easy-to-access messages to listeners. You can either listen to them in real-time as they are written to a new block or also retrieve historical events from the past. It makes it easy to create an audit trail this way. You will often see events used to communicate that a new token was minted.\n",
    "\n",
    "Chapter 8:\n",
    "Inheritance\n",
    "As our contracts grow in complexity, we want to split our code further and make it easier to maintain. This helps with isolated testing increasing the security of the individual contracts. But Inheritance can become very complex as it hides dependencies as you can inherit from contracts that inherit from other contracts. So we must take care when using it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Solidity supports multiple inheritances we can use to derive from other contracts using the is keyword. Parent contracts must be listed in the order from “most base-like” to “most derived” as the order of inheritance matters. Child contracts can override parent functions using the override keyword if the parent contract is allowed using the virtual keyword for the given function. So Solidity allows for polymorphism.\n",
    "\n",
    "contract A {\n",
    " function foo() public pure virtual returns(string memory) {\n",
    "   return \"A\";\n",
    " }\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "contract B is A {\n",
    " function foo() public pure override returns(string memory) {\n",
    "   return \"B\";\n",

    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "contract C is A {\n",
    " function foo() public pure virtual override returns(string memory) {\n",
    "   return \"C\";\n",
    " }\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "Functions can be overridden as long as the function signature remains the same. A derived contract can also access all non-private members like state variables and internal methods. This is especially helpful when having functions that are needed repeatedly but that you do not want to define and implement for each contract.\n",
    "\n",
    "Child contracts can inherit from multiple parent contracts. And there might be cases where you want to do something custom for a specific contract but also call the function from the parent contract. We can use the super keyword here.\n",
    "\n",
    "contract D is B, C {\n",
    "  function foo() public pure override(B, C) returns(string memory) {\n",
    "    return super.foo();\n",
    "  }\n",
    "}\n",
    "When an overridden function is called, parent contracts are executed from right to left and depth-first. So in this case D.foo() would return “C” since C is the last contract that we have defined in the override function.\n",
    "\n",
    "Inheritance can lead to critical errors as it hides complexity and implementation details. But it is also helpful to organize your code in a way where you can inherit functions, state variables and function modifiers to be used in other contracts.\n",
    "\n",
    "Chapter 9:\n",
    "Constructors\n",
    "It is likely that you want to deploy the same contract with different initial values. Until now, you only learned how to set initial values. So you would always need to write a new contract with updated initial values in the Solidity code. This is unpractical. Fortunately, Solidity offers a constructor, a special function executed upon contract creation.\n",
    "\n",
    "contract Foo {\n",
    "uint public amount;\n",
    "   constructor(uint _amount) {\n",

    "   constructor(uint _amount) {\n",
    "       amountBar = _amount;\n",
    "   }\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "There can only be one constructor per contract and a constructor is defined using the constructor keyword. The arguments are passed during contract creation, allowing us to set initial values for the state variables. There is always a constructor in place. If you do not define one, there is a default constructor. Once the contract is created, the code is deployed on the blockchain.\n",
    "\n",
    "Child contracts inhering from a parent contract can also call their parent constructors. You can do this either directly when defining the contract or in the child contract constructor:\n",
    "\n",
    "contract A is Foo(42) {\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "contract B is Bar {\n",
    "  constructor(uint _amount) Bar(_amount) {}\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "It is important to note that parent constructors are always called in order of inheritance. So if you use the child constructor to pass the values, you should always check the order of inheritance They are always called from right to left. Let’s look at an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "contract C is Foo, Bar {\n",
    " constructor() Bar(5) Foo(42) {}\n",
    "}\n",
    "So here the constructor of Bar is called first with the value 5, then the Foo constructor is called with the value 42 and then the constructor of C is called. Remember this when using constructors because it might introduce weird behavior to your contracts if you have a different assumption.\n",

    "Randomness\n",
    "With your newfound power, understanding of what smart contracts are you want to develop a smart contract to raffle an NFT to your friends. But how will you get randomness into your raffle smart contract?\n",
    "Randomness is essential for many types of applications. Think about how many games have randomness built-in. Rolling dice in dungeons and dragons, a random starting hand of poker, or a random next block in Tetris, randomness is an essential component of a majority of games. As we learned in Chainlink 101, smart contracts are a powerful tool for decentralized applications (dapps). But what if you want to build a game, raffle or any other type of application that utilizes randomness on the blockchain? Let's learn about randomness on the blockchain in the next lesson!\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Chapter 2:\n",
    "Randomness and Blockchains\n",
    "\n",
    "Upon research, you realize popular languages like Javascript have built-in randomness functions maybe you can use something like that in Solidity? \n",
    "Blockchains are deterministic, meaning that any computations that use blockchains must have predictable outcomes. This so all of the nodes that run the blockchain can come to an agreement on what the blockchain is. But deterministic runs counter to random. If everyone knows what the next hand of poker will be before it is dealt it wouldn’t be considered random. So if randomness is impossible on a blockchain, how can we bring the awesome powers of smart contracts to any applications that need randomness?\n",
    "\n",
    "We could get the randomness from an outside resource! But it can’t be a trusted centralized service (as discussed in Chainlink 101), or we would be ruining the decentralized properties of blockchains and smart contracts. And it would be great if it could be verified that the number wasn’t tampered with and is genuinely random. This is a perfect example of where a decentralized oracle network powered by Chainlink could be used!\n",
    "\n",
    "Chapter 3:\n",
    "Chainlink VRF\n",
    "So you’ve realized that you need Chainlink VRF to build your raffle. But what makes Chainlink VRF so special?\n",
    "As discussed in the previous lesson randomness provided by an outside service needs to be verifiable and decentralized, and that’s exactly what Chainlink VRF is! VRF stands for Verifiable Randomness Function. Essentially Chainlink VRF provides cryptographic proof alongside every random number generated, that the random number wasn’t tampered with (and indeed generated in a random way).\n",
    "\n",
    "How does this cryptographic proof work? It’s quite mathematically complicated and outside the scope of this lesson, but you can read more about it in the “Technical Walkthrough” section of this blog post. The cryptographic proof is then verified by a smart contract on-chain, which means it is verified by every node on the blockchain! This completes our verifiable and decentralized criteria. So now we understand that Chainlink VRF is verifiably random and decentralized how do we use it?\n",
    "\n",
    "Chapter 4:\n",
    "Architecture of Chainlink VRF\n",
    "Every programmer knows it’s good to have at least a basic understanding of how the technology you use works! Time to dive into the inner workings of Chainlink VRF a bit.\n",

    "The VRF Coordinator Contract (VRFCoordinatorV2)\n",
    "VRF Client Contract:\n",
    "\n",
    "The contract you are building must import and inherit the client contract. It allows your contract to send the proper requests and receive answers from the Chainlink VRF. To send requests it allows your contract to utilize a function called “RequestRandomness”. To receive answers your contract will need to have a “FulfillRandomness” function. To import the Client Contract you need only one line at the top of your Solidity code:\n",
    "\n",
    "import \"@chainlink/contracts/src/v0.8/VRFConsumerBaseV2.sol\";\n",
    "And to inherit the contract you must put the following when naming your contract:\n",
    "\n",
    "contract VRFv2Consumer is VRFConsumerBaseV2\n",
    "VRF Coordinator Contract:\n",
    "\n",
    "The Coordinator contract has two main duties. Manage subscriptions to the Chainlink VRF and verify every random number alongside its proof. A VRF subscription represents a contract that wants to receive a random number, how many random numbers it wants to receive, and how many LINK tokens have been pre-paid for that contact (as for every Chainlink service LINK tokens are used to pay the Chainlink VRF for every random number requested). So it essentially coordinates the random numbers sent out by Chainlink VRF!\n",
    "\n",
    "Chapter 5: VRF Subscriptions\n",
    "Subscribing to the VRF\n",
    "Just like all Chainlink powered services, we must pay the Chainlink VRF for the work completed by using the LINK token. In the past, in version one of Chainlink VRF, this involved sending a set amount of LINK tokens alongside each request. And because a contract itself sends out the requests, this meant that smart contracts had to be sent LINK before they could request a random number. \n",
    "\n",
    "VRFv2\n",
    "In VRFv2, the most recent version of the VRF, the concept of a subscription was added. What is a subscription? Essentially, it's an account created on the VRFCoordinator contract that can be funded with LINK tokens and points to \"consumer\" contracts that want to request randomness. Once a subscription is set-up a consumer contract can then request randomness, the VRF respondes with a random number and proof, and then after the random number is included on-chain the VRF is paid with some of the LINK prepaid in the subscription.\n",
    "\n",
    "The power that comes from this subscription model is that now consumer contracts have much more flexibility in requesting random numbers. Before subscriptions it was a static price, and the VRF always returned a single random number. \n",
    "\n",
    "But what if the consumer contract needs more than one random number? The consumer contract can now specify how many random numbers it wants to request.  \n",
    "\n",
    "What if the consumer contract needs the random number to be included very fast by paying a higher gas price? The consumer contract can now request how much it's willing to pay for gas. This is called the gas lane. \n",
    "\n",
    "What if the consumer contract needs to run some heavy calculations after recieving the random number? It can set a limit to how much gas will be spent by the VRF when submitting the random number. This is called the callbackGasLimit.\n",
    "\n",
    "And because this is all pre-paid via the subscription, and credited from the subscription amount after the VRF has responded with a random number, the amount of LINK token to be paid to the VRF can be dynamic based on network conditions. When demand to get transactions into a blockchain is high, and thus gas prices are high, more LINK will be deducted to compensate the gas the VRF has to pay to get it's random number transaction on-chain. Or if you don't want the contract to request random numbers when the gas price is high, you can specify that via the Gas Lane. The more random numbers the contract requests at once the more expensive it will be. And finally the higher the computational load of the function the consumer contract runs when recieving a random number; the more gas it will cost for the VRF to submit a random number.\n",
    "\n",
    "The subscription model added in Chainlink VRFv2 is a powerful tool, enabling any consumer contract requesting a random number to determine how it wants that random number!\n",

Every request also generates a \"requestId\" which uniquely identifies every request sent and we will also store the latest requestId. To do this we will create two storage variables; one for the latest random numbers called s_randomWords and one for the latest requestId called s_requestId. Finally we will be creating a subscription for our contract when we deploy it and we will create a variable of type address to store the wallet address of the wallet that owns the subscription.\n",

    "Introduction\n",
    "In daily life, we use the term random very loosely. We use it whenever we do not have a quick explanation expressing the statistical probability of a particular event happening. This leads to wrong assumptions and false predictions. \n",
    "Let’s take the Monte Carlo fallacy as an example. It describes the mistaken belief that past events that occur more often than others are less likely to happen in the future (or vice versa) though they are statistically independent. If you play roulette in a casino and see that red has appeared ten times behind in a row, you might believe that it’s more likely that the next color will be black. But as soon as you apply statistics, you must admit that there is no reason to assume that the next color is more likely to be black. The occurrence is random.\n",
    "\n",
    "Several other fallacies should make us very cautious in trusting our intuitive understanding of statistics and randomness. As dependencies get more complex or hidden and the numbers increase, we tend to lose the ability to assess probabilities correctly and intuitively. So we will look a little deeper into randomness and the difficulty for deterministic systems like blockchains to create randomness at the beginning of this course. Once we understand the challenges, we will look into potential solutions to this problem and especially learn more about Verifiable Random Functions. Equipped with this new knowledge, we will get practical and will understand how to create subscriptions and add consumer contracts programmatically. At this point, you should have a good understanding of randomness and how to use VRF v2 in your applications. So the final chapters will focus on common pitfalls you should avoid while using VRF v2.\n",
    "\n",
    "Chapter 2:\n",
    "Randomness and Deterministic Machines\n",
    "Computers are deterministic machines. Per definition, they cannot produce randomness without any external inputs. Once this external input is given, Computer Science has found different methods to generate random numbers. We distinguish between true random number generators (RNG) and pseudo-random number generators (PRNG). You can use a PRNG if your random generator does not need any security guarantees. For example, if you are programming a simple coin-flipping game that you want to use daily to decide between two options, you can use a PRNG like JavaScripts Math.random(). It uses computational algorithms to produce apparently random results. These results are entirely depending on an initial seed. So if the seed is known, the same result can be reproduced.\n",
    "\n",
    "This might work for prototypes and many practical applications. But imagine you want to encrypt a message. You would use a public key to encrypt the message and only the private key could decrypt it. The private key needs to be created at some point. Public key cryptography uses random numbers as input to calculate and create key pairs. If your source of randomness is something like Math.random(), it will be far more feasible for an attacker to guess your private key by brute-forcing the “random” numbers which is produced by this function. In other words, it drastically reduces the search space for the attacker. And the more they know about your conditions, the easier it is for them to find the correct private key as they have to search through fewer options.\n",
    "\n",
    "Luckily, there are also true random number generators that we can use. They usually rely on measuring physical phenomena like atmospheric noise. It uses a natural source of entropy to avoid any brute-force attacks. This is critical to generating random numbers. Unpredictability is an essential requirement for true random number generators. Unpredictable means no one can reproduce the result by taking the same system as an input. So you cannot simply measure the same atmospheric noise to produce similar results. They will be completely different. So the quality of entropy becomes a fundamental metric. Once this is given, there are different tools to translate this into random numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Chapter 3:\n",
    "Randomness and Blockchains\n",
    "Blockchains heavily rely on cryptography and randomness for security. The most straightforward example is the creation of key pairs used to do transactions. When you create a new key pair, a random number is needed as the initial input. We have learned in the previous example how to obtain this number from, e.g., the physical world. This number is then used to calculate a seed which is further used to derive all further key pairs.\n",
    "\n",
    "This works well for key creation, but how to use random numbers on-chain? While the initial number could be completely random, as soon as you add it to a transaction, everyone who observes the mempool can see it. And also, the miners/validators can see it and decide how to deal with your transaction based on the number. This also would mean that someone controls the creation of the random number. So you must trust this source. So the random number cannot be created on-chain and must be provided from the outside. Is there no other way?\n",
    "\n",
    "You might argue that you can use the content of a block as a source of randomness. But these values can be actively manipulated by miners. They could add or remove transactions to find a result that benefits them. In addition, blocks also have particular properties that could reduce the search space to calculate probabilities that a specific number will be selected. So this is an insecure way of creating random numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "So if you cannot trust the miners, you could argue for using Oracles. A trusted third-party system could be used to create random numbers and then provide them to services via an oracle. But depending on the economic incentive, someone could be interested in hacking this system to provide non-random numbers as input. And while they might use a true random number generator, you don’t know for sure and do not have any way to check the validity of such a statement once the number was generated.\n",
    "\n",
    "So we must address two further issues here. The single point of failure (single oracle) and validating that the number was generated with a particular function. For the first issue, you could argue that you could use decentralized oracle network (DON). So it wouldn’t be a single oracle that we need to trust.\n",
    "But how do we know this DON is not generating numbers based on certain conditions? For this reason, Verifiable Random Functions are used. They allow everyone to verify that a specific VRF was used and that the number was produced by a particular VRF and no other function. This allows us to generate verifiable random numbers for on-chain usage in a decentralized way.\n",
    "\n",
    "Chapter 4:\n",
    "Goldberg’s Verifiable Random Function\n",
    "As we have seen in the previous chapters, randomness is a non-trivial problem that needs proper consideration and analysis to ensure that the randomness is unpredictable. One of Chainlink's VRF v2 core features are based on scientific research and implement Goldberg's Verifiable Random Function (see details here). Goldberg defines VRF as the public-key version of a keyed cryptographic hash. Anyone with the corresponding public key can verify the correctness of the hash. But only the holder of the secret VRF key can compute the hash. The VRF created by Goldberg et al. is being standardized by IETF and is also used by others in production (e.g., Algorand). It provides an \"entirely unpredictable (uniformly distributed) to anyone who doesn't know the seed or secret key.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's try to understand this a little better. You can imagine VRF as a public-key pseudorandom function. It can be used to prove that the output was calculated for that given function. But only the owner of the secret key can compute the output for any given input value. Others can use the public key to check if the output was calculated using the given function. So it allows us to produce unpredictable (and uniformly distributed) results while being fully verifiable.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Chainlink, a contract is used to provide a seed (via an Ethereum log) to generate a random number. The oracle hashes this input to get a cryptographically secure random sample from secp256k1 using the block data and the oracle's public key. This is the base to use the VRF to create a random number. The oracle then sends back the proof with the public key and the input seed (and some additional values for the signature). Afterward, it gets verified by the VRF machinery and is sent to the consuming contract if it was correct. The random number is then published on-chain with proof that it was generated using the VRF.\n",
    "\n",
    "Chapter 5: VRF Subscriptions\n",
    "Subscription Manager Contract\n",
    "Now that we learned more about the theoretical background, let’s get practical. We want to create and manage a subscription contract. We will use the example contract that you can find here on Remix. It shows an example implementation of a VRF v2 Subscription manager for the Goerli network. But you can also adjust it to work with other networks by changing the code's hardcoded addresses. You can find a complete list of available networks here.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hint: This course assumes you are already familiar with the Architecture of Chainlink VRF from VRFv2 Introduction Chapter 4.\n",
    "\n",
    "Generally, consumer contracts must implement the requestRandomWords() function providing coordinator parameters and subscription ID. This function is used to create random values. A second function, fulfillRandomWords(), must be implemented to receive the random values. Learn about how to implement the basics of such a contract in chapters 6-12 from the introduction course.\n",
    "\n",
    "We want to focus on the mentioned functions here and show how to manage subscriptions in this contract. So let’s start by creating a new subscription:\n",

    " }\n",
    "We shall call this function when the contract is initially deployed using the constructor. The COORDINATOR is set to the COORDINATOR address in your network of choice. It is used to call the createSubscription() function. This returns an ID which is then used to add a new consumer using the same COORDINATOR contract. That’s already all you need to create a subscription and add a consumer. Now we can expand this and add or remove consumers using the corresponding functions (addConsumer, removeConsumer) to generate random numbers.\n",

    "  COORDINATOR.removeConsumer(s_subscriptionId, consumerAddress);\n",
    "}\n",

    "This was pretty straight forward. Before we implement the mandatory functions mentioned in the beginning, we will also add a function to topup the subscription with LINK tokens.

Now that we have the ability to manage consumers and funding, we will implement a simple function to request random words and received a request ID that we can use to get the random words.

    "You can see that we don’t need to provide any parameters here though the COORDINATOR expects 5 of them. We have hard coded these values in the contract, but you could also ask the caller of the function to provide these values depending on your implementation. Let’s look into each parameter.\n",
    "\n",

    "callbackGasLimit allows to set the the limit so more complex contracts can be developed using a single transaction to get verifiable randomness to their contract.\n",
    "numWords defines the number of random values which we want to get in one request.\n",

Let’s explore how validators could potentially manipulate the generation of random numbers and other surprises. You can read more about it here.\n",
    "\n",
    "As we learned in the previous chapter, the VRF service will call your fulfillRandomWords() function once the request has been completed. If your function reverts, the VRF service will not try to call it another time. So you must be careful when assuming that you will always have updated random numbers. It is only true in case the call was not reverted. It could revert because a simple requirement was not fulfilled or a bug happened:\n",
    "\n",
    "function fulfillRandomWords(\n",
    "uint256, / requestId /\n",
    "uint256[] memory randomWords\n",
    ") internal override {\n",
    "s_randomWords = randomWords;\n",
    "require(randomWords[0] % 50 > 10)\n",
    "}\n",
    "If you requested a random number but are still waiting for an answer, do not call the function again until you get a response. Because VRF service could withhold a VRF fulfillment if the outcome is not desirable and hope that the second request is more favorable to them, you would potentially increase the chances of an attacker cheating your application. Imagine you implemented a simple coin flip smart contract using VRF v2. In a bet function, you choose heads or tails and then request a random number. If you have selected heads (0) and the result of the VRF service meant that you would win the bet, it could try to withhold this answer and replace it with your second request if it’s more advantageous.\n",
    "\n",
    "So you see, we must consider the unique properties of blockchains here to ensure randomness in our smart contracts. While the numbers are always random, we must also look into how our applications and smart contracts deal with them. In the end, it will be a matter of cost if it's worth attacking your application. You must also be aware of the protocol that you are using.\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, re-organizations on chains are possible. A miner would take your request and try to create a new random number with a different block and do this until they find a block to their advantage. They cannot control the VRF output but can \"re-roll\" the dice. If they manage to produce a valid blockchain with this new block and the network accepts this block instead, they could effectively attack your application by controlling the random input.\n",
    "While this is a possible attack, it's costly to attack a network like this, as in the proof of network. You need at least 51% of the network to drive such an attack. Depending on your application requirements, you consider a 20-block confirmation time highly secure. You can lower the block confirmation time depending on the value you are trying to protect. You must calculate an attacker's costs and potential reward to decide your confirmation time.\n",
