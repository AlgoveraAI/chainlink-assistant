Why does calling an external API in chainlink not cause inconsistency?
URL: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/70130661/why-does-calling-an-external-api-in-chainlink-not-cause-inconsistency

Question Body:


Suppose I have a smart contract that uses Chainlink's ""Call Any External API""
capability to get some data from an external URL. My understanding is that
each Ethereum full node runs each smart contract to verify the status; it does
so to verify the latest block. But what if, between the time one full node
runs the contract and another one does, the data returned by calling tha
external API changes. Then it would seem that different full nodes would get
different results for that smart contract, resulting in inconsistent states.
Why does that not happen?

Because oracle responses are stored on-chain.

You are right, if fetching external data was part of the validation process,
no nodes would be able to reach a consensus. So instead, a Chainlink oracle
network places the data on-chain in a transaction, and then it goes through
the same validation process as every other transaction.

You can read more about how Chainlink's [Basic Request
Model](https://docs.chain.link/docs/architecture-request-model/) looks, but
this is basically the reason why having an oracle system built into a
blockchain is impossible.

When a make a call to a public API, how does chainlink verifies the response or it does not?

Question Body:


Example --> I made a API call to
<https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts/1> and got my desired response.  
But how does chainlink verifies the information that it is indeed correct.  
If not, is it not essentially removing one of the main benefits blockchain has
**'decentrialization'**?



Answers:
(Answered on: 2022-07-13 21:19:41)


**TLDR:** The basic example from the [docs](https://docs.chain.link) is
nothing but a building block of how to do it. It's an example of pulling from
a single API through a single node. To make this decentralized, you'd have to
pull many APIs through many different nodes.

The Chainlink Any API call feature should be considered the bare bones of a
Chainlink node. One piece of the whole picture. Analogously, a single Ethereum
node processing transactions would be centralized, and a single Chainlink node
responding with API data would be as well.

So we need many Ethereum nodes to process transactions to verify the
transactions are being processed correctly and many Chainlink nodes to verify
the data are being processed correctly. So if you want to get data through
Chainlink, you should use many nodes, and ideally many different data sources
as well - and that's how you can verify the data is correct.

Why is our Chainlink node not catching any OracleRequest events from our Arbitrum Operator? Requests are never fulfilled / v2 jobs never executed
URL: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/74777534/why-is-our-chainlink-node-not-catching-any-oraclerequest-events-from-our-arbitru

Question Body:


We're trying to get our Chainlink AnyAPI stack to work with an Arbitrum
Chainlink node. The same stack is being used on Ethereum, Polygon and
Avalanche without issue.

Chainlink AnyAPI empowers some of the use cases of DSLA Protocol, a middleware
for adding consumer protection capabilities to any monitorable marketplace
(e.g. OpenSea) using peer-to-peer service level agreements (SLA).

## Request Lifecycle

Here are the different steps involved in verifying that a SLA contract has
been respected, using Chainlink:

  1. A user calls the verification function on the Messenger smart contract that implements Chainlink.

  2. The `Messenger` smart contract sends the request the `PreCoordinator` smart contract .

  3. The `PreCoordinator` forwards the request to the Oracles defined in a Service Agreement (proxy of Oracles).

  4. Upon receiving LINK, each Oracle sends the request to the Chainlink node, by emitting an `OracleRequest` event with the id of the job to be executed.

  5. The Chainlink node captures such event, and executes the corresponding job.

  6. Once the job is executed, the Chainlink node calls the `fulfillOracleRequest2` function to return the result from the external adapter to the PreCoordinator.

  7. The PreCoordinator takes the mean of all Oracle results and ultimately registers the SLI in the messenger.

Generally, When we create new job on node it assign externalJobId to job which
is like '07269a61-586c-4831-bc26-7d2b581fbd1c'. But when you call function in
consumer contract you have to provide this externalJobId in function without
dashes so it will be like '07269a61586c4831bc267d2b581fbd1c'. This is not
mentioned in chainlink docs in noticeable way

:::NEXT DOC:::

the result back to your contract.
There might be multiple reasons, but most likely something is wrong when the
Chainlink node calls the function `fulfillOracleRequest2` in the
[Operator.sol](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/chainlink/blob/develop/contracts/src/v0.7/Operator.sol)
and fails to write the result back to your contract.

Please check the following:

  1. Check if you fund your Chainlink node. You can check the balance of the chainlink node in the top right of the Chainlink node UI which is usually with port number 6688(eg. http://localhost:6688). Because the Chainlink node changes the state of the blockchain when calling the function in the contract operator, there has to be a minimum balance of ETH remaining in your Chainlink node. The solution to the issue is just to transfer some ETH(not LINK) tokens to your chainlink node address. [](https://i.stack.imgur.com/nXWT5.jpg)

  2. Check if you grant the Chainlink node permission to call function `fulfillOracleRequest2` in the contract operator. Search your Chainlink node address in the blockchain explorer like [etherscan](https://etherscan.io/), [goerliscan](https://goerli.etherscan.io/), [polygonscan](https://polygonscan.com/), etc. and if the node has no permission to call function `fulfillOracleRequest`, error `Fail with error 'Not authorized sender'` will be thrown. The solution to the issue is to use the function `setAuthorizedSenders` to grant the node address permission to call the function `fulfillOracleRequest2`.





:::NEXT DOC:::

use [Chainlink Any-
API](https://docs.chain.link/docs/make-a-http-get-request/) calls to bring it
into your smart contract

To do so, you need to know 3 things

  1. The API endpoint that contains the data, and the inputs required
  2. The outputs that the API returns, including their types (integer, string etc), as well as the path in the resulting JSON that contains the data you want
  3. A Chainlink oracle on the network you're contract is on that has a compatible job that you can use (whether one you run yourself or someone elses)

Once you have these things, you can use the example consumer contract in the
docs linked above, and then change the values to suit. ie here is an example
contract that will make an API call to PancakeSwap to get the price of
PancakeSwap token on BSC testnet:

1 - API address and inputs. In this case, according to your linked docs, the
URL of the API call is
`https://api.pancakeswap.info/api/v2/tokens/0x0E09FaBB73Bd3Ade0a17ECC321fD13a19e81cE82`.
The only input required is the token address in the URL

2 - We want the price, which is an integer and in the 'price' JSON element. We
will multiply the price by 10**8 when we bring it on-chain because Solidity
can't handle decimals

3 - Because this is a simple API call, we can use a community run CL node that
takes a HTTP GET request, parses the JSON to find an element we specify, then
multiplies the result and converts it to the type we want before returning it
on-chain. Taking a look at the [BSC testnet jobs

Do not install Hardhat globally. If you already have installed hardhat
globally, please uninstall as the issue might be because of that as mentioned
in the error message.

Things you need to do to mitigate this:

  1. Check if the project package.json has hardhat as its dev dependency. If it is not, run `npm install --save-dev hardhat` or `yarn add --dev hardhat`
  2. Uninstall any global version of hardhat
  3. Remove node_modules and run `npm install` or `yarn install` to install all dependencies.
  4. Try running `npx hardhat compile` or `npx hardhat node` to check if it works.

`https://api.pancakeswap.info/api/v2/tokens/0x0E09FaBB73Bd3Ade0a17ECC321fD13a19e81cE82`.
The only input required is the token address in the URL

2 - We want the price, which is an integer and in the 'price' JSON element. We
will multiply the price by 10**8 when we bring it on-chain because Solidity
can't handle decimals

3 - Because this is a simple API call, we can use a community run CL node that
takes a HTTP GET request, parses the JSON to find an element we specify, then
multiplies the result and converts it to the type we want before returning it
on-chain. Taking a look at the [BSC testnet jobs on
market.link](https://market.link/search/jobs?hierarchicalMenu%5BhierarchicalCategories.lvl0%5D=Binance&sortBy=job_created_at_desc),
I found a suitable one
[here](https://market.link/jobs/c314932c-2ee7-449b-b9f7-c2ba8fcf0ad2) (GET,
multiples result, returns a uint). From here we take the job ID and the oracle
address, and note the cost in LINK required to use it

Now that we have all these details, we can modify the standard API consumer
contract and put them all in, as follows. Changes I made include updating
variables to reflect price instead of volume, also i changed the variables for
job, oracle contract and fee, and i changed the setPublicChainlinkToken()
method in the contructor to setChainlinkToken, specifically passing in the
address of the [LINK token on BSC testnet](https://docs.chain.link/docs/link-

How to get price information from Chainlink?
URL: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/70053205/how-to-get-price-information-from-chainlink

Question Body:


I would like to get USD price of DeFi tokens from Chainlink.

However, it looks like, I can get the price of an asset through either the
[Chainlink API calls](https://docs.chain.link/docs/make-a-http-get-request/),
or [Chainlink price feeds](https://docs.chain.link/docs/get-the-latest-
price/).

What are the costs associated with each and the differences and tradeoffs?



Answers:
(Answered on: 2021-11-22 19:28:33)


**With[Chainlink price feeds](https://docs.chain.link/docs/get-the-latest-
price/)**, each data feed is updated by a decentralized oracle network. Each
oracle in the set publishes data during an aggregation round. That data is
validated and aggregated by a smart contract, which forms the feed's latest
and trusted answer.

Each oracle operator is rewarded for publishing data. On mainnet, [sponsors
are paying the LINK
associated](https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/questions/90728/what-is-the-
cost-of-using-a-chainlink-oracle/90752#90752) to keep those feeds live,
decentralized, and secure, so they are not free. This allows the network to be
a shared resource where everyone chips in a tiny bit and makes them even
cheaper than running even your own centralized feed.

That being said, the price feeds are currently a simple `view` function, and
anyone can technically use them as access controls are on the roadmap to be
built at some point.

:::NEXT DOC:::

use [Chainlink Any-
API](https://docs.chain.link/docs/make-a-http-get-request/) calls to bring it
into your smart contract

To do so, you need to know 3 things

  1. The API endpoint that contains the data, and the inputs required
  2. The outputs that the API returns, including their types (integer, string etc), as well as the path in the resulting JSON that contains the data you want
  3. A Chainlink oracle on the network you're contract is on that has a compatible job that you can use (whether one you run yourself or someone elses)

Once you have these things, you can use the example consumer contract in the
docs linked above, and then change the values to suit. ie here is an example
contract that will make an API call to PancakeSwap to get the price of
PancakeSwap token on BSC testnet:

1 - API address and inputs. In this case, according to your linked docs, the
URL of the API call is
`https://api.pancakeswap.info/api/v2/tokens/0x0E09FaBB73Bd3Ade0a17ECC321fD13a19e81cE82`.
The only input required is the token address in the URL

2 - We want the price, which is an integer and in the 'price' JSON element. We
will multiply the price by 10**8 when we bring it on-chain because Solidity
can't handle decimals

3 - Because this is a simple API call, we can use a community run CL node that
takes a HTTP GET request, parses the JSON to find an element we specify, then
multiplies the result and converts it to the type we want before returning it
on-chain. Taking a look at the [BSC testnet jobs

here](https://docs.chain.link/data-feeds/price-feeds/addresses/) get the
`ETH/USD` goerli testnet address:""0xD4a33860578De61DBAbDc8BFdb98FD742fA7028e""

  * Now in order to call chainlink oracle you have to have `LINK` token in your contract. Get some link token to your conract address [from the faucet](https://faucets.chain.link/)

  * Import the token in metamask. you will see the amount

  * send link token from your metamask to your contract

  * deploy your contract. if you are using `Remix IDE` chose the `injected provider` to connect to metamask. Because chainlink contract is on goerli, so you need to be on Goerli testnet. Once deployment goes through you can call the `fund` function.

  * Since the `fund` function has no argument, you need to send the value alongside the transaction. That is why inside the function you have `msg.value` to access to the sent amount.

  * In `Remix` ide, under ""GAS LIMIT`input there is`VALUE`input. you need to pass the amount in there before you call the`fund` function.

Looking at the Etherscan activity, it looks like the node you are using may be
inactive. Try this node and jobId:

    
    
    Oracle = 0xc57B33452b4F7BB189bB5AfaE9cc4aBa1f7a4FD8; 
    JobId = ""d5270d1c311941d0b08bead21fea7747"";
    

These were taken from the [Chainlink Official
Docs](https://docs.chain.link/docs/decentralized-oracles-ethereum-mainnet/).

To check to see if a node may be inactive or not, check out the oracle address
in a block explorer. [You can see
here](https://kovan.etherscan.io/address/0x56dd6586db0d08c6ce7b2f2805af28616e082455)
that the original node you tried to use hasn't posted a transaction in quite a
long time.

If a node is inactive you will need to find a new one or host one yourself. To
find more nodes and jobs, you can check [market.link](https://market.link/) or
use the one found in the docs as mentioned earlier.

Why is our Chainlink node not catching any OracleRequest events from our Arbitrum Operator? Requests are never fulfilled / v2 jobs never executed
URL: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/74777534/why-is-our-chainlink-node-not-catching-any-oraclerequest-events-from-our-arbitru

Question Body:


We're trying to get our Chainlink AnyAPI stack to work with an Arbitrum
Chainlink node. The same stack is being used on Ethereum, Polygon and
Avalanche without issue.

Chainlink AnyAPI empowers some of the use cases of DSLA Protocol, a middleware
for adding consumer protection capabilities to any monitorable marketplace
(e.g. OpenSea) using peer-to-peer service level agreements (SLA).

## Request Lifecycle

Here are the different steps involved in verifying that a SLA contract has
been respected, using Chainlink:

  1. A user calls the verification function on the Messenger smart contract that implements Chainlink.

  2. The `Messenger` smart contract sends the request the `PreCoordinator` smart contract .

  3. The `PreCoordinator` forwards the request to the Oracles defined in a Service Agreement (proxy of Oracles).

  4. Upon receiving LINK, each Oracle sends the request to the Chainlink node, by emitting an `OracleRequest` event with the id of the job to be executed.

  5. The Chainlink node captures such event, and executes the corresponding job.

  6. Once the job is executed, the Chainlink node calls the `fulfillOracleRequest2` function to return the result from the external adapter to the PreCoordinator.

  7. The PreCoordinator takes the mean of all Oracle results and ultimately registers the SLI in the messenger.

The chainlink VRF is a 2 transaction process.

The first transaction requests the random number, and the second to have the
random number returned. You can't get the random number in 1 go.

You can read more about the [basic request
model](https://docs.chain.link/docs/architecture-request-model/) in the
documentation.

You're `letsgo` function will not work.

could rewrite
the chain's history to put a randomness request from your contract into a
different block, which would result in a different VRF output. Note that this
does not enable a miner to determine the random value in advance. It only
enables them to get a fresh random value that might or might not be to their
advantage. By way of analogy, they can only re-roll the dice, not predetermine
or predict which side it will land on.

You must choose an appropriate confirmation time for the randomness requests
you make. Confirmation time is how many blocks the VRF service waits before
writing a fulfillment to the chain to make potential rewrite attacks
unprofitable in the context of your application and its value-at-risk.

## Do not re-request randomness

Any re-request of randomness is an incorrect use of VRFv2. Doing so would give
the VRF service provider the option to withhold a VRF fulfillment if the
outcome is not favorable to them and wait for the re-request in the hopes that
they get a better outcome, similar to the considerations with block
confirmation time.

Re-requesting randomness is easily detectable on-chain and should be avoided
for use cases that want to be considered as using VRFv2 correctly.

## Don't accept bids/bets/inputs after you have made a randomness request

Consider the example of a contract that mints a random NFT in response to a
user's actions.

The contract should:

  1. Record whatever actions of the user may affect the generated NFT.
  2. **Stop accepting further user actions that might affect the generated NFT** and issue a randomness request.
  3. On randomness fulfillment, mint the NFT.

Generally speaking, whenever an outcome in your contract depends on some user-
supplied inputs and randomness, the contract should not accept any additional
user-supplied inputs after it submits the randomness request.

Otherwise, the cryptoeconomic security properties may

how to consume random numbers with Chainlink VRF in smart
contracts.

## How is randomness generated on blockchains? What is Chainlink VRF?

Randomness is very difficult to generate on blockchains. This is because every
node on the blockchain must come to the same conclusion and form a consensus.
Even though random numbers are versatile and useful in a variety of blockchain
applications, they cannot be generated natively in smart contracts. The
solution to this issue is [**Chainlink VRF**](/vrf/v2/introduction), also
known as Chainlink Verifiable Random Function.

## What is the Request and Receive cycle?

The [previous guide](/getting-started/consuming-data-feeds) explained how to
consume Chainlink Data Feeds, which consist of reference data posted on-chain
by oracles. This data is stored in a contract and can be referenced by
consumers until the oracle updates the data again.

Randomness, on the other hand, cannot be reference data. If the result of
randomness is stored on-chain, any actor could retrieve the value and predict
the outcome. Instead, randomness must be requested from an oracle, which
generates a number and a cryptographic proof. Then, the oracle returns that
result to the contract that requested it. This sequence is known as the
**[Request and Receive cycle](/architecture-overview/architecture-request-model)**.

## What is the payment process for generating a random number?

VRF requests receive funding from subscription accounts. The [Subscription
Manager](https://vrf.chain.link) lets you create an account and pre-pay for
VRF requests, so that funding of all your application requests are managed in
a single location. To learn more about VRF requests funding, see
[Subscriptions limits](/vrf/v2/subscription#subscription-limits).

# Introduction to Chainlink VRF

  * Overview
  * Two methods to request randomness
  * Choosing the correct method
  * Supported networks

Get Started

Access verified randomness at [vrf.chain.link](https://vrf.chain.link).

**Chainlink VRF (Verifiable Random Function)** is a provably fair and
verifiable random number generator (RNG) that enables smart contracts to
access random values without compromising security or usability. For each
request, Chainlink VRF generates one or more random values and cryptographic
proof of how those values were determined. The proof is published and verified
on-chain before any consuming applications can use it. This process ensures
that results cannot be tampered with or manipulated by any single entity
including oracle operators, miners, users, or smart contract developers.

Security Considerations

Be sure to review your contracts with the [security
considerations](/vrf/v2/security/) in mind.

Use Chainlink VRF to build reliable smart contracts for any applications that
rely on unpredictable outcomes:

  * Building blockchain games and NFTs.
  * Random assignment of duties and resources. For example, randomly assigning judges to cases.
  * Choosing a representative sample for consensus mechanisms.

## Two methods to request randomness

Chainlink VRF v2 offers two methods for requesting randomness:

  * [Subscription](/vrf/v2/subscription): Create a subscription account and fund its balance with LINK tokens. Users can then connect multiple consuming contracts to the subscription account. When the consuming contracts request randomness, the transaction costs are calculated after the randomness requests are fulfilled and the subscription balance is deducted accordingly. This method allows you to fund requests for multiple consumer contracts from a single subscription.
  * [Direct funding](/vrf/v2/direct-funding): Consuming contracts directly pay with LINK when they request random values. You must directly fund your consumer contracts and ensure that there are enough LINK tokens to pay for randomness requests.

## Choosing the correct method

Depending on your use case, one method might be more suitable than another.
Consider the following characteristics when you choose a method:

# Summary

For pseudorandomness you can use something like
[EIP-4399](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4399):

    
    
    uint256 randomness = uint(keccak256(abi.encodePacked(msg.sender, block.difficulty, block.timestamp)));
    

(You don't even need to use assembly, `difficulty` is directly exposed in
solidity)

But for true randomness, you'd need something like [Chainlink
VRF](https://docs.chain.link/docs/vrf/v2/subscription/examples/get-a-random-
number/).

    
    
        function fulfillRandomWords(uint256 _requestId, uint256[] memory _randomWords) internal override {
            uint256 randomness = _randomWords[0];
        }
    

## Why is `difficulty` or `PREVRANDAO` pseudo-random in a post-merge ETH?

When a validator is due to propose a block, they face a [fairly minimal
penalty](https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/questions/90781/what-is-the-
penalty-of-having-eth2-validator-offline) for failing to do so. Given a smart
contract that is trying to make itself unpredictable/uncontrollable via
`PREVRANDAO`, this option allows them to cheaply bias the behavior of the
contract in the following ways.

### 1\. You always need a validator to propose two blocks in a row

`PREVRANDAO`'s value has no

increase the chances of an attacker cheating your application. Imagine you implemented a simple coin flip smart contract using VRF v2. In a bet function, you choose heads or tails and then request a random number. If you have selected heads (0) and the result of the VRF service meant that you would win the bet, it could try to withhold this answer and replace it with your second request if it뗩 more advantageous.

So you see, we must consider the unique properties of blockchains here to ensure randomness in our smart contracts. While the numbers are always random, we must also look into how our applications and smart contracts deal with them. In the end, it will be a matter of cost if it's worth attacking your application. You must also be aware of the protocol that you are using.

In general, re-organizations on chains are possible. A miner would take your request and try to create a new random number with a different block and do this until they find a block to their advantage. They cannot control the VRF output but can ""re-roll"" the dice. If they manage to produce a valid blockchain with this new block and the network accepts this block instead, they could effectively attack your application by controlling the random input.
While this is a possible attack, it's costly to attack a network like this, as in the proof of network. You need at least 51% of the network to drive such an attack. Depending on your application requirements, you consider a 20-block confirmation time highly secure. You can lower the block confirmation time depending on the value you are trying to protect. You must calculate an attacker's costs and potential reward to decide your confirmation time.

Maximum Gas for Callback

If your `fulfillRandomness` function uses more than 200k gas, the transaction
will fail.

## Getting More Randomness

If you are looking for how to turn a single result into multiple random
numbers, check out our guide on [Randomness Expansion](/vrf/v1/best-practices/#getting-multiple-random-numbers).

## Network Congestion and Responsiveness

Network congestion can occur on all blockchains from time to time, which may
result in transactions taking longer to get included in a block. During times
of network congestion, the VRF service will continue responding to randomness
requests, but fulfillment response times will corresponding increase based on
the level of congestion. It is important you account for this in your use case
and set expectations accordingly.

when the checkUpkeep returns true to execute the upkeep

In order to solve the problem like ""Why Chainlink checkUpkeep does not
execute"", I suggest doing the following things to debug your upkeep.

  1. Since `checkUpkeep` and `performUpkeep` are both triggered by [Chainlink automation](https://automation.chain.link/), you need to check your automation subscription first. In the automation app, double check the contract address is correct.
  2. Because the chainlink node has to change the state of blockchain(call `performUpkeep` in your consumer contract), it has to pay the gas fee. It is important to make sure there is a minimum balance of LINK in your subscription.
  3. Test if `checkUpkeep` works as expected. If the pre-defined condition for automation is satisfied in your smart contract, `checkUpkeep` should return true. Chainlink automation only calls `performUpkeep` when `checkUpkeep` returns `true`, so the upkeep does not work if `checkUpkeep` cannot return true. Call `checkUpkeep` by yourself to test if it works properly. If you cannot get `true` as returned value, automation cannot get `true` either.
  4. Test if `performUpkeep` works as expected. The mechanism of Chainlink automation is to call `performUpkeep` when `checkUpkeep` returns `true`, so you must make sure the `performUpkeep` can be called by automation. Try to call the `performUpkeep` manually to see if it works properly.

Hope it helps!

I don't know if this is a too simple question but I'm wondering how to avoid
an external Upkeep run my checkUpkeep function of my contract if, at the end,
my contract's address is public and that's the only thing you need to run the
checkUpkeep. I want to avoid that someone can call this function of my

For those who are facing this problem, I found a solution that could be
applicable for some of you. The caller address for checkUpkeep and
performUpkeep is the registry address you can find in the dashboard to manage
your upkeeps. So, what I've done is to create a modifier that allows only my
registry address to run these functions. I hope this information could be
helpful for any of you!

TLDR; Use [revalidation](https://docs.chain.link/chainlink-
automation/compatible-contracts/#revalidate-performupkeep) in `performUpkeep`
prior to running.

The best method for preventing the upkeep functions from being called when
they should be is through revalidating the conditions for calling them. You
could require that the caller be the `Automation Registry`, which would limit
who could execute the function, but this would not prevent someone else

more information





:::NEXT DOC:::

actions must be performed only when specific conditions are met. Check
all of the preconditions within `performUpkeep` to ensure that state change
occurs only when necessary.

In this pattern, it is undesirable for the state change to occur until the
next time the Upkeep is checked by the network and the conditions are met. It
is a best practice to stop any state change or effects by performing the same
checks or similar checks that you use in `checkUpkeep`. These checks validate
the conditions before doing the work.

For example, if you have a contract where you create a timer in `checkUpkeep`
that is designed to start a game at a specific time, validate the condition to
ensure third-party calls to your `performUpkeep` function do not start the
game at a different time.

### Perform upkeep ONLY when data is verified via `performData`

Some actions must be performed using data you intend to use. Revalidate that
the `performData` is allowed before execution.

For example, if you have a `performUpkeep` that funds a wallet and the address
of the wallet is received via the `performData` parameter, ensure you have a
list of permissable addresses to compare against to prevent third-party
calling your function to send money to their address.

### When performing actions in Automation-compatible contracts is not harmful

Sometimes actions must be performed when conditions are met, but performing
actions when conditions are not met is still acceptable. Condition checks
within `performUpkeep` might not be required, but it can still be a good
practice to short circuit expensive and unnecessary on-chain processing when
it is not required.

It might be desirable to call `performUpkeep` when the `checkUpkeep`
conditions haven't yet been tested by Chainlink Automation, so any specific
checks that you perform are entirely use case specific.

### Always test your contract

As with all smart contract testing, it is important to test the boundaries of
your smart contract in

If your upkeeps are not being performed make sure to double-check the next
items:

  * Are Chainlink Keepers currently available on the network you are deploying to?
  * Is your smart contract `KeeperCompatible`?
  * Call `checkUpkeep`. Did it return `true` or `false`?
  * Can you `performUpkeep`?
  * Did you register your contract for upkeeps?
  * Did you fund it?

How do I configure the perform upkeep to know which function to call? How do I
make sure it calls the correct function?



Answers:
(Answered on: 2021-11-24 21:36:27)


There are a number of ways you can have the keepers call the correct function.
One way would be to add information in your `performData` designating which
function to call.

The performUpkeep looks like this:

    
    
    function performUpkeep(bytes calldata performData) external override {
            // conditional to call one function
            // conditional to call a different function
        }
    

## 1\. The Better way

When the Chainlink keepers call `checkUpkeep` they pass the returned
information of `performData` to the input of `performUpkeep`. You can
[encode](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.10/units-and-global-
variables.html?highlight=abi.encode#abi-encoding-and-decoding-functions) just

Chain Link VRF takes a long time to get random numbers
URL: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/68107865/chain-link-vrf-takes-a-long-time-to-get-random-numbers

Question Body:


**Description**

Getting a random number takes a really long time. After executing the
getRandomNumber function, a few minutes go by before I can interact with my
random number.

Basically I click getRandomNumber and have to wait 2-3 minutes until the
random number shows up in the randomResult variable.

**Steps to Reproduce**

  1. Head over to the documentation here : <https://docs.chain.link/docs/get-a-random-number/>
  2. Scroll down and click on ""Deploy this contract using Remix"" (blue outline btn)
  3. Click on one of the folders that looks like 536123b61468ad4442cfc4278e8de577 then RandomNumberConsumer.sol
  4. Replace the LINK Token, VRF Coordinator, and Key Hash to be unique to rinkeby <https://docs.chain.link/docs/vrf-contracts/>
  5. Navigation to the Solidity Compiler Tab and click on Compile RandomNumber.sol.
  6. Deploy the contract on Rinkeby
  7. Copy to contract address and send LINK token to fund the contract.
  8. Click on the orange getRandomNumber btn in remix
  9. Click on randomResult and observe how long it takes for the value in randomResult to change. (Keep clicking until it finally changes)

**Additional Information**

I am not sure if this behavior is intentional or if I need to change up the
code. Ideally I would like to have the value of randomResult once the
getRandomNumber function finishes executing. Right now I don't know when the
value

Chainlink VRF follows the [request and
receive](https://docs.chain.link/docs/intermediates-tutorial/#1-request--
receive) cycle of getting a number. This means, it has to look outside the
blockchain to get a response.

So, 2 transactions actually take place:

  1. Your requesting transaction
  2. The response transaction

This is necessary to look outside the blockchain like this, otherwise you'll
get a deterministic number as opposed to random. The speed at which the random
number is returned, is dictated by the block time of the blockchain you're
using.

So for Ethereum, the fastest time possible for a Random Number to be returned
is 2 * block time, or about 30ish seconds.

On faster chains like polygon, this is drastically lower.

Ethereum test network Rinkeby

    
    
      function getRandomNumber() public returns (bytes32 requestId)

        randomResult = randomness;
        _requestId = requestId;
      }
    

This works fine, deducts the LINK fee from my wallet, and eeeeeventually does
call back `fulfillRandomness` with a random hex value, however it takes
forever!

Just did a test and it took 30 minutes. Could I be doing something wrong or
why is it taking so long? I know it's async and there's lots of stuff going on
to fetch the random number, but at these speeds it's basically unusable right

This is a blockchain question. I'm following the tutorial from freecodecamp

My issue is when I try to get a verified random number from the

You probably using incorrect addresses for the parameters. Chainlink has two
main variations. Since you are using `VRFConsumerBase` this is VRf V1, you can
get addresses from [here](https://docs.chain.link/vrf/v1/supported-networks).
I used those for goerli:

    
    
    link address           = 0x326C977E6efc84E512bB9C30f76E30c160eD06FB
    key hash               = 0x0476f9a745b61ea5c0ab224d3a6e4c99f0b02fce4da01143a4f70aa80ae76e8a
    
    ChainlinkVRFCoordinator= 0x2bce784e69d2Ff36c71edcB9F88358dB0DfB55b4
    

After you deploy the contract, you have to send link token to the contract,
because you need to pay for the `fee` parameter that you set. [link token

You press on `getRandomNumber` button and you need to wait a little bit upto a

## Getting More Randomness

If you are looking for how to turn a single result into multiple random
numbers, check out our guide on [Randomness Expansion](/vrf/v1/best-practices/#getting-multiple-random-numbers).

## Network Congestion and Responsiveness

Network congestion can occur on all blockchains from time to time, which may
result in transactions taking longer to get included in a block. During times
of network congestion, the VRF service will continue responding to randomness
requests, but fulfillment response times will corresponding increase based on
the level of congestion. It is important you account for this in your use case
and set expectations accordingly.

how to consume random numbers with Chainlink VRF in smart
contracts.

## How is randomness generated on blockchains? What is Chainlink VRF?

Randomness is very difficult to generate on blockchains. This is because every
node on the blockchain must come to the same conclusion and form a consensus.
Even though random numbers are versatile and useful in a variety of blockchain
applications, they cannot be generated natively in smart contracts. The
solution to this issue is [**Chainlink VRF**](/vrf/v2/introduction), also
known as Chainlink Verifiable Random Function.

## What is the Request and Receive cycle?

The [previous guide](/getting-started/consuming-data-feeds) explained how to
consume Chainlink Data Feeds, which consist of reference data posted on-chain
by oracles. This data is stored in a contract and can be referenced by
consumers until the oracle updates the data again.

Randomness, on the other hand, cannot be reference data. If the result of
randomness is stored on-chain, any actor could retrieve the value and predict
the outcome. Instead, randomness must be requested from an oracle, which
generates a number and a cryptographic proof. Then, the oracle returns that
result to the contract that requested it. This sequence is known as the
**[Request and Receive cycle](/architecture-overview/architecture-request-model)**.

## What is the payment process for generating a random number?

VRF requests receive funding from subscription accounts. The [Subscription
Manager](https://vrf.chain.link) lets you create an account and pre-pay for
VRF requests, so that funding of all your application requests are managed in
a single location. To learn more about VRF requests funding, see
[Subscriptions limits](/vrf/v2/subscription#subscription-limits).

After you call the `getRandomNumber()` function you will need to wait until
the `fulfillRandomness()` is called by the coordinator. You don't need to do
anything, just check the storage variable where you store the number (if you
used a storage variable) after a minute or two.

increase the chances of an attacker cheating your application. Imagine you implemented a simple coin flip smart contract using VRF v2. In a bet function, you choose heads or tails and then request a random number. If you have selected heads (0) and the result of the VRF service meant that you would win the bet, it could try to withhold this answer and replace it with your second request if it뗩 more advantageous.

So you see, we must consider the unique properties of blockchains here to ensure randomness in our smart contracts. While the numbers are always random, we must also look into how our applications and smart contracts deal with them. In the end, it will be a matter of cost if it's worth attacking your application. You must also be aware of the protocol that you are using.

In general, re-organizations on chains are possible. A miner would take your request and try to create a new random number with a different block and do this until they find a block to their advantage. They cannot control the VRF output but can ""re-roll"" the dice. If they manage to produce a valid blockchain with this new block and the network accepts this block instead, they could effectively attack your application by controlling the random input.
While this is a possible attack, it's costly to attack a network like this, as in the proof of network. You need at least 51% of the network to drive such an attack. Depending on your application requirements, you consider a 20-block confirmation time highly secure. You can lower the block confirmation time depending on the value you are trying to protect. You must calculate an attacker's costs and potential reward to decide your confirmation time.

be included in
the external adapter's response back to the Chainlink node.

An example of what the error response payload should look like:


    {
      ""error"": ""The endpoint is under maintenance.""
    }

### Asynchronous callbacks

Some job types support external callbacks. When supported, Chainlink will
provide a non-null `responseURL` alongside the request payload.

If the external adapter wants to return data immediately it can simply respond
with data directly as normal.

If the external adapter wants to use the response URL to send data later, it
may initially return a response like this:


    {
      ""pending"": true
    }

In this case, the job run on Chainlink side will be put into a `pending`
state, awaiting data which can be delivered at a later date.

When the external adapter is ready, it should callback to the node to resume
the JobRun using an HTTP PATCH request to the `responseURL` field. This will
resume the job on the Chainlink side.


    {
      ""data"": {
        ""symbol"": ""ETH-USD"",
        ""last"": {
          ""price"": 467.85,

          ""timestamp"": 1528926483463
        }
      }
    }

Or, for the error case:


    {
      ""error"": ""something went wrong""
    }

### Example

Here is a complete example of a simple external adapter written as a
serverless function. This external adapter takes two input fields, inserts the
API key as a header, and returns the resulting payload to the node.

If you're External Adapter (EA) is running on `http://localhost:8080` and
you're trying to reach that EA from a Chainlink node running inside Docker,
then you can't use `localhost`, you need to get out of the Docker container
and onto the host running the Docker engine (your Windows or Mac machine).

To do, so define your bridge to use `http://host.docker.internal:8080`.

Further details can be found in the [Docker

# Bridges: Adding External Adapters to Nodes

  * Overview
  * Testing External Adapters and Bridges

You can add external adapters to a Chainlink node by creating a bridge in the
Node Operators Interface. Each bridge must have a unique name and a URL for
the external adapter. If a job has a [Bridge Task](/chainlink-nodes/oracle-jobs/all-tasks/#bridge-task), the node searches for a bridge by name and uses
that bridge as your external adapter. Bridge names are case insensitive.

To create a bridge on the node, go to the **Create Bridge** tab in the Node
Operators Interface. Specify a name for the bridge, the URL for your external
adapter, and optionally specify the minimum contract payment and number of
confirmations for the bridge. Minimum contract payment is a fee paid in LINK
for the Chainlink node making a call to the external adapter via the bridge.
This fee is in addition to the fee specified at the global node level for
processing job requests.



The bridge name must be unique to the local node. The bridge URL is the URL of
your external adapter, which can be local or on a separate machine.

To add jobs that use the bridge, add a [Bridge Task](/chainlink-nodes/oracle-jobs/all-tasks/#bridge-task) to your job. The `bridge` task defined in the
example below is defined as `fetch` and the name of the bridge is `soccer-
data`.


    type = ""directrequest""
    schemaVersion = 1
    name = ""Soccer-Data-EA""
    contractAddress = ""0xA74F1E1Bb6204B9397Dac33AE970E68F8aBC7651""

the result back to your contract.
There might be multiple reasons, but most likely something is wrong when the
Chainlink node calls the function `fulfillOracleRequest2` in the
[Operator.sol](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/chainlink/blob/develop/contracts/src/v0.7/Operator.sol)
and fails to write the result back to your contract.

Please check the following:

  1. Check if you fund your Chainlink node. You can check the balance of the chainlink node in the top right of the Chainlink node UI which is usually with port number 6688(eg. http://localhost:6688). Because the Chainlink node changes the state of the blockchain when calling the function in the contract operator, there has to be a minimum balance of ETH remaining in your Chainlink node. The solution to the issue is just to transfer some ETH(not LINK) tokens to your chainlink node address. [](https://i.stack.imgur.com/nXWT5.jpg)

  2. Check if you grant the Chainlink node permission to call function `fulfillOracleRequest2` in the contract operator. Search your Chainlink node address in the blockchain explorer like [etherscan](https://etherscan.io/), [goerliscan](https://goerli.etherscan.io/), [polygonscan](https://polygonscan.com/), etc. and if the node has no permission to call function `fulfillOracleRequest`, error `Fail with error 'Not authorized sender'` will be thrown. The solution to the issue is to use the function `setAuthorizedSenders` to grant the node address permission to call the function `fulfillOracleRequest2`.

Chainlink jobs returns error if external adapter takes too long for response
URL: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/75796310/chainlink-jobs-returns-error-if-external-adapter-takes-too-long-for-response

Question Body:


I am encountering this error when running a job via my own chainlink node even
though the external adapter is returning the data properly. `HTTP request
timed out or interrupted` This error is triggered during the ""fetch"" function
of the job. I have figured that the error is triggered because my external
adapter is taking some time to respond. Is there any way I can make my
chainlink node wait longer?

I tried a response with dummy data that did not require any API to fetch and
the job ran perfectly. The error has been fixed by the given answer.

However now after the job sends the data back to my oracle,
FulfillOracleRequest2 is not executing.

be included in
the external adapter's response back to the Chainlink node.

An example of what the error response payload should look like:


    {
      ""error"": ""The endpoint is under maintenance.""
    }

### Asynchronous callbacks

Some job types support external callbacks. When supported, Chainlink will
provide a non-null `responseURL` alongside the request payload.

If the external adapter wants to return data immediately it can simply respond
with data directly as normal.

If the external adapter wants to use the response URL to send data later, it
may initially return a response like this:


    {
      ""pending"": true
    }

In this case, the job run on Chainlink side will be put into a `pending`
state, awaiting data which can be delivered at a later date.

When the external adapter is ready, it should callback to the node to resume
the JobRun using an HTTP PATCH request to the `responseURL` field. This will
resume the job on the Chainlink side.


    {
      ""data"": {
        ""symbol"": ""ETH-USD"",
        ""last"": {
          ""price"": 467.85,
          ""size"": 0.01816561,
          ""timestamp"": 1528926483463
        }
      }
    }

Or, for the error case:


    {
      ""error"": ""something went wrong""
    }

### Example

Here is a complete example of a simple external adapter written as a
serverless function. This external adapter takes two input fields, inserts the
API key as a header, and returns the resulting payload to the node.

The problem is, in the chainlink node, specifically in the `fetch` method it
gives me an error: `error making http request: Post ""http://localhost:8080"":
dial tcp 127.0.0.1:8080: connect: connection refused`

Is it related to the docker container? I don't see why it wouldn't be able to
request resuources from another port in the same machine. Am I missing some
configuration maybe? From what I've read from the docs it's possible to run
the adapter locally. Below, a picture with more information:

If you're External Adapter (EA) is running on `http://localhost:8080` and
you're trying to reach that EA from a Chainlink node running inside Docker,
then you can't use `localhost`, you need to get out of the Docker container
and onto the host running the Docker engine (your Windows or Mac machine).

To do, so define your bridge to use `http://host.docker.internal:8080`.

I've found the solution: in your consumer contract: set fee = 1 * 10 ** 18;
not 0.1 or in your .env file:
MINIMUM_CONTRACT_PAYMENT_LINK_JUELS=100000000000000000 set fee = 1

(Answered on: 2021-12-27 02:26:00)


Modify the fee to 1 * 10**18 in your consumer contract, or add a line to your
`.env` file and reboot your CL node:

    
    
    MINIMUM_CONTRACT_PAYMENT_LINK_JUELS=100000000000000000
    

which means, change the minimum link payment to 0.1LINK globally.

# Bridges: Adding External Adapters to Nodes

  * Overview
  * Testing External Adapters and Bridges

You can add external adapters to a Chainlink node by creating a bridge in the
Node Operators Interface. Each bridge must have a unique name and a URL for
the external adapter. If a job has a [Bridge Task](/chainlink-nodes/oracle-jobs/all-tasks/#bridge-task), the node searches for a bridge by name and uses
that bridge as your external adapter. Bridge names are case insensitive.

To create a bridge on the node, go to the **Create Bridge** tab in the Node
Operators Interface. Specify a name for the bridge, the URL for your external
adapter, and optionally specify the minimum contract payment and number of
confirmations for the bridge. Minimum contract payment is a fee paid in LINK
for the Chainlink node making a call to the external adapter via the bridge.
This fee is in addition to the fee specified at the global node level for
processing job requests.



The bridge name must be unique to the local node. The bridge URL is the URL of
your external adapter, which can be local or on a separate machine.

To add jobs that use the bridge, add a [Bridge Task](/chainlink-nodes/oracle-jobs/all-tasks/#bridge-task) to your job. The `bridge` task defined in the
example below is defined as `fetch` and the name of the bridge is `soccer-
data`.


    type = ""directrequest""
    schemaVersion = 1
    name = ""Soccer-Data-EA""
    contractAddress = ""0xA74F1E1Bb6204B9397Dac33AE970E68F8aBC7651""
    maxTaskDuration = ""0s""
    observationSource = """"""

the result back to your contract.
There might be multiple reasons, but most likely something is wrong when the
Chainlink node calls the function `fulfillOracleRequest2` in the
[Operator.sol](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/chainlink/blob/develop/contracts/src/v0.7/Operator.sol)
and fails to write the result back to your contract.

Please check the following:

  1. Check if you fund your Chainlink node. You can check the balance of the chainlink node in the top right of the Chainlink node UI which is usually with port number 6688(eg. http://localhost:6688). Because the Chainlink node changes the state of the blockchain when calling the function in the contract operator, there has to be a minimum balance of ETH remaining in your Chainlink node. The solution to the issue is just to transfer some ETH(not LINK) tokens to your chainlink node address. [](https://i.stack.imgur.com/nXWT5.jpg)

  2. Check if you grant the Chainlink node permission to call function `fulfillOracleRequest2` in the contract operator. Search your Chainlink node address in the blockchain explorer like [etherscan](https://etherscan.io/), [goerliscan](https://goerli.etherscan.io/), [polygonscan](https://polygonscan.com/), etc. and if the node has no permission to call function `fulfillOracleRequest`, error `Fail with error 'Not authorized sender'` will be thrown.

# Adding External Initiators to Nodes

  * Overview
  * Creating an external initiator
  * Deleting an external initiator
  * Listing external initiators

note

External initiators are disabled on nodes by default. Set the
`FEATURE_EXTERNAL_INITIATORS=true` [configuration variable](/chainlink-nodes/v1/configuration/#feature_external_initiators) to enable this feature.

## Creating an external initiator

To create an external initiator you must use the remote API. You can do this
yourself, like so:


    POST http://<your chainlink node>/v2/external_initiators -d <PAYLOAD>

where payload is a JSON blob that contains:


    {
      ""name"": <MANDATORY UNIQUE NAME>,
      ""url"": <OPTIONAL EXTERNAL INITIATOR URL>
    }

If a URL is provided, Chainlink will notify this URL of added and deleted jobs
that can be triggered by this external initiator. This allows the external
initiator to program in certain actions e.g. subscribing/unsubscribing to logs
based on the job, etc.

On creation:


    POST <URL> -d {""jobId"": <job external UUID>, ""type"": <name of external initiator>, ""params"": <optional arbitrary JSON specified at job creation time>}

On deletion:


    DELETE <URL>/<job external UUID>

You can use the chainlink client for convenience to access this API.

Enter the [Chainlink nodes CLI](/chainlink-nodes/resources/miscellaneous/#execute-commands-running-docker) and run the
following command


    chainlink initiators create <NAME> <URL>

`NAME`: The name you want to use

:::NEXT DOC:::

external initiator must be created before the webhook job, and must be
referenced by name (whitelisted) in order for that external initiator to be
allowed to trigger the given webhook job.

When the External Initiator is created it generates two pairs of credentials:
Outgoing and Incoming. The Outgoing Access Key and Secret are used to
authenticate messages sent from the Core to the External Initiator. The
Incoming Access Key and Secret are used to authenticate messages sent from the
External Initiator to the Core.

Then, once you've created the name, bridge, and have the correct access keys
for the URL, you can proceed to use the external initiator as if it's a
regular initiator in future job specs.

# Introduction

  * Overview

External initiators allow jobs in a node to be initiated depending on some
external condition. The ability to create and add external initiators to
Chainlink nodes enables blockchain agnostic cross-chain compatibility.

note

At this time of writing, external initiators do not show up in the bridges
tab. However, they act exactly the same as if they did.

note

External initiators are disabled on nodes by default. Set the
`FEATURE_EXTERNAL_INITIATORS=true` [configuration variable](/chainlink-nodes/v1/configuration/#feature_external_initiators) to enable this feature.

Initiator Bridges handle the authentication to and from the External Initiator
and where to send the messages. When creating a Bridge two parameters are
required:

Only the [webhook](/chainlink-nodes/oracle-jobs/all-jobs/#webhook-jobs) job
type can be initiated using an External Initiator.

The external initiator must be created before the webhook job, and must be
referenced by name (whitelisted) in order for that external initiator to be
allowed to trigger the given webhook job.

When the External Initiator is created it generates two pairs of credentials:
Outgoing and Incoming. The Outgoing Access Key and Secret are used to
authenticate messages sent from the Core to the External Initiator. The
Incoming Access Key and Secret are used to authenticate messages sent from the
External Initiator to the Core.

Then, once you've created the name, bridge, and have the correct access keys
for the URL, you can proceed to use the external initiator as if it's a
regular initiator in future job specs.

For how to create an external initiator see [adding external initiators

EI and then checking to see if a sample job kicks off is the best way to
test this.

To try a real-life example, feel free to follow along with the [Conflux EI
demo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8oJEp4qz5w).

Additional external initiator reference

note

The External Initiator can only initiate [webhook jobs](/chainlink-nodes/oracle-jobs/job-types/webhook) that have been linked to it. Trying to
initiate a job that is not linked will give an unauthorised error.

## Deleting an external initiator

To delete an external initiator you must use the remote API. You can do this
yourself, like so:


    DELETE http://<your chainlink node>/v2/external_initiators/<external initiator name>

You can alternatively use the chainlink client for convenience:


    chainlink initiators destroy <NAME>

## Listing external initiators

To see your installed external initiators:


    GET http://<your chainlink node>/v2/external_initiators?size=100&page=1

Or, using the chainlink client:

repo for
reference. You can see some examples of existing initiators in the
[blockchain](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/external-initiator/tree/master/blockchain) folder.

External initiators are simple web initiators that can be activated by any job
instead of just one. To set one up, you need to have a service similar to an
external adapter that sends an `HTTPPost` message runs API call to your
chainlink node service. Here is a sample URL for a web job could look like:


    curl -b cookiefile -X POST -H ""Content-Type: application/json"" --data '{""myKey"":""myVal""}' http://localhost:6688/v2/jobs/%s/runs

Where `%s` is the jobId.

External initiators make the same API call, with 2 added headers:

  1. ""X-Chainlink-EA-AccessKey""

All this is working smoothly when I'm doing things manually. But when I'm

## Maintain a Minimum Balance

Each Upkeep has a [minimum balance](/chainlink-automation/automation-economics/#minimum-balance) to ensure that an Upkeeps will still run should a
sudden spike occur. If your Upkeep LINK balance drops below this amount, the
Upkeep will not be performed.

To account for Upkeep execution over time and possible extended gas spikes,
maintain an Upkeep LINK balance that is 3 to 5 times the minimum balance. Note
if you have an upkeep that performs frequently you may want to increase the
buffer to ensure a reasonable interval before you need to fund again.
Developers also have the ability to update `performGasLimit` for an upkeep.

## Withdraw funds

To withdraw funds, the Upkeep administrator have to cancel the Upkeep first.
There is a 50 block delay once an Upkeep has been cancelled before funds can
be withdrawn. Once 50 blocks have passed, select **Withdraw funds**.

## Interacting directly with the Chainlink Automation Registry

After registration, you can interact directly with the [registry
contract](/chainlink-automation/supported-networks/#configurations) functions
such as `cancelUpkeep` and `addFunds` using your **Upkeep ID**. The Registry

**Prerequisites**

  1. [Get some LINK tokens](https://faucets.chain.link/goerli) in your browser wallet
  2. Deploy a Chainlink Keepers-compatible contract -- this is your Upkeep contract; the one that will be automated. [Here is the example Upkeep smart contract](https://docs.chain.link/docs/chainlink-keepers/compatible-contracts/#example-contract) that you can copy and deploy right away. You can use `10` as the `interval` \-- that's 10 seconds. This way you can see the upkeep happen fast. **Note this Upkeep's address**
  3. Next, deploy the `UpkeepIDConsumerExample` from the [example in the docs](https://docs.chain.link/docs/chainlink-keepers/register-upkeep/#register-an-upkeep-using-your-own-deployed-contract), which is the smart contract that programmatically registers your Upkeep Contract. This contract handles registering the Upkeep Contract you deployed in Step #2 with Chainlink's Keepers network, so that the Keepers Network can automate the running of functions in your Upkeep contract. **Note this Contracts Address**

**Making it work**

  1. From your wallet, which should now have LINK in it, send 5 LINK to the deployed `UpkeepIDConsumerExample` address. This is funding it will need to send onwards to your Upkeep (Upkeeps need funding so they can pay the Keepers Network for the compute work they do in performing the automations).

  2. Using Remix, connect to the right network and then connect to your deployed `UpkeepIDConsumerExample` contract by using its address.

the Upkeep.

ERC677 Link

For funding on Mainnet, you need ERC-677 LINK. Many token bridges give you

deployed contract have to call the Transfer-and-Call function on the respective ERC-677 LINK contract configured on the Registrar and ensure they pass the correct encoded function call and inputs.

## How it works

Automation Nodes follow a turn-taking algorithm to service upkeeps. A turn is
a number of blocks and you can find the block count per turn for your network
in the [configuration](/chainlink-automation/supported-networks/#configurations) section. During a turn a Upkeeps on the registry are
randomly split, ordered into buckets, and assigned to an Automation Node to
service them. Even if an Automation Node goes down, the network has built-in
redundancy and your Upkeep will be performed by the next Automation Node in
line.

During every block, the Automation Node reviews all of the upkeeps in its
bucket to determine which upkeeps are eligible. This check is done off-chain
using a geth simulation. The Automation Node checks both the `checkUpkeep` and
`performUpkeep` conditions independently using simulation. If both are true
(eligible), and the upkeep is funded, the Automation Node proceeds to execute
the transaction on-chain.

While only one Automation Node monitors an upkeep at any point during a turn,
an upkeep can have multiple on-chain transaction executions per turn. This is
accomplished with a buddy-system. After a transaction is confirmed, the next
Automation Node in the line monitors the upkeep. After a new transaction is
confirmed, the previous Automation Node steps in again to monitor the upkeep
until the end of the turn or until another transaction confirmation is
complete. This creates a system that is secure and highly available. If a node
becomes faulty and executes a transaction that is not eligible, the next node
does not execute a transaction, which breaks the process.

Chainlink Automation use the same transaction manager mechanism built and used
by Chainlink Data Feeds. This creates a

Testing and best practices

Follow the [best practices](/chainlink-automation/compatible-contract-best-practice) when creating a compatible contract and test your upkeep on a
testnet before deploying it to a mainnet.

  6. **Click`Register upkeep`** and confirm the transaction in MetaMask. 

Your upkeeps will be displayed in your list of **Active Upkeeps**. You must
monitor the balance of your upkeep. If the balance drops below the **minimum
balance** , the Chainlink Automation Network will not perform the Upkeep. See
[Managing Upkeeps](/chainlink-automation/manage-upkeeps) to learn how to
manage your upkeeps.

## Register an Upkeep using your own deployed contract

You can dynamically create and manage Upkeeps using your own smart contracts.
The following example displays a smart contract that can create an Upkeep and
determine the Upkeep ID. You can also program your Upkeep to check its own
balance and fund itself by interacting with the registry.

### Prerequisites

Find the following addresses for your network:

  * Correct [LINK token contract](/resources/link-token-contracts)
  * [Registry and registrar addresses for your network](/chainlink-automation/supported-networks/#configurations)

Optionally, you can fetch the LINK address and registrar address from the
intended registry at run-time.

Fund your contract

Make sure your contract has enough [ERC-677 LINK](/resources/link-token-contracts) to fund the Upkeep at creation. _The minimum amount is 0.1 LINK._

Blockchains are deterministic, meaning that any computations that use blockchains must have predictable outcomes.

If everyone knows what the next hand of poker will be before it is dealt it wouldn뗪 be considered random. So if randomness is impossible on a blockchain, how can we bring the awesome powers of smart contracts to any applications that need randomness?

We could get the randomness from an outside resource! But it can뗪 be a trusted centralized service (as discussed in Chainlink 101), or we would be ruining the decentralized properties of blockchains and smart contracts. And it would be great if it could be verified that the number wasn뗪 tampered with and is genuinely random.

#####Chapter 3:

# Randomness and Blockchains

Blockchains heavily rely on cryptography and randomness for security. The most straightforward example is the creation of key pairs used to do transactions. When you create a new key pair, a random number is needed as the initial input. We have learned in the previous example how to obtain this number from, e.g., the physical world. This number is then used to calculate a seed which is further used to derive all further key pairs.

This works well for key creation, but how to use random numbers on-chain? While the initial number could be completely random, as soon as you add it to a transaction, everyone who observes the mempool can see it. And also, the miners/validators can see it and decide how to deal with your transaction based on the number. This also would mean that someone controls the creation of the random number. So you must trust this source. So the random number cannot be created on-chain and must be provided from the outside. Is there no other way?

You might argue that you can use the content of a block as a source of randomness. But these values can be actively manipulated by miners. They could add or remove transactions to find a result that benefits them. In addition, blocks also have particular properties that could reduce the search space to calculate probabilities that a specific number will be selected. So this is an insecure way of creating random numbers.

So if you cannot trust the miners, you could argue for using Oracles. A trusted third-party system could be used to create random numbers and then provide them to services via an oracle. But depending on the economic incentive, someone could be interested in hacking this system to provide non-random numbers as input. And while they might use a true random number generator, you don뗪 know for sure and

receive) cycle of getting a number. This means, it has to look outside the
blockchain to get a response.

So, 2 transactions actually take place:

  1. Your requesting transaction
  2. The response transaction

This is necessary to look outside the blockchain like this, otherwise you'll
get a deterministic number as opposed to random. The speed at which the random
number is returned, is dictated by the block time of the blockchain you're
using.

So for Ethereum, the fastest time possible for a Random Number to be returned
is 2 * block time, or about 30ish seconds.

On faster chains like polygon, this is drastically lower.

increase the chances of an attacker cheating your application. Imagine you implemented a simple coin flip smart contract using VRF v2. In a bet function, you choose heads or tails and then request a random number. If you have selected heads (0) and the result of the VRF service meant that you would win the bet, it could try to withhold this answer and replace it with your second request if it뗩 more advantageous.

So you see, we must consider the unique properties of blockchains here to ensure randomness in our smart contracts. While the numbers are always random, we must also look into how our applications and smart contracts deal with them. In the end, it will be a matter of cost if it's worth attacking your application. You must also be aware of the protocol that you are using.

In general, re-organizations on chains are possible. A miner would take your request and try to create a new random number with a different block and do this until they find a block to their advantage. They cannot control the VRF output but can ""re-roll"" the dice. If they manage to produce a valid blockchain with this new block and the network accepts this block instead, they could effectively attack your application by controlling the random input.
While this is a possible attack, it's costly to attack a network like this, as in the proof of network. You need at least 51% of the network to drive such an attack. Depending on your application requirements, you consider a 20-block confirmation time highly secure. You can lower the block confirmation time depending on the value you are trying to protect. You must calculate an attacker's costs and potential reward to decide your confirmation time.

Randomness is essential for many types of applications. Think about how many games have randomness built-in.

As we learned in Chainlink 101, smart contracts are a powerful tool for decentralized applications (dapps).

### 2\. Validators can choose to not post if a number is unfavorable

Once again, you still run into this issue from pre-merge. The penalty of not
posting a block is almost negligible, so a node might be financially
incentivized not to propose blocks in a lottery-type smart contract if the
`PREVRAND` value isn't what they want. Enough nodes do this and you run into
issues.

Just taking the current `PREVRANDAO` value without looking at recent history
gives a validator some control over the output the contract will use, even if
it doesn't want to abort, because the validator can decide whether or not the
block it proposes contains a transaction which will trigger the use of
PREVRANDAO. The only cost involved there is the transaction fee/tip.

### 3\. If all applications use `PREVRANDAO` as their seed

If all applications use `PREVRANDAO` as their seed, in a way, you could
""chain"" together wins or hacks based on this.

Question Body:


I do understand the concept of gas in the ethereum blockchain and why gas is
needed to compensate miners for providing computing power to the network.
However, when I was reading up on the chainlink vrf get a random number
documentation it says that the keyhash tells you the gas lane to use. It would
be really helpful if someone could further explain what a gas lane in
blockchain is.

Any help would be appreciated :)

So we know that Eth gas is always subject to change and with chainlink vrf
there will be random values with your request, so you need to set a limit to
how much to spend on each request. The reason chainlink uses a Gas lane is
because the lanes are important for setting the ceiling limit of each
request... think of it as your entry into the bet.

estimation error` is a common error meaning that you don't have enough of
""something"" to send your transaction, maybe it's layer 1 (ETH) gas, or an
ERC20 token like LINK (technically, erc677, but I digress...)

Whenever you work with a Chainlink feature that uses the [request and

using chainlink, you need to [fund the consumer contract with LINK

The issue here is you sent LINK to the oracle address and not the address of
your deployed contract.

If you copy the address of your deployed contract and send the LINK there, it
should work for you.

help reduce gas costs on chains that support it. This is supported only on
official Ethereum mainnet and testnets. It is not recommended to enable this
setting on Polygon because the EIP-1559 fee market appears to be broken on all
Polygon chains and EIP-1559 transactions are less likely to be included than
legacy transactions.

#### Technical details

Chainlink nodes include experimental support for submitting transactions using
type 0x2 (EIP-1559) envelope.

EIP-1559 mode is enabled by default on the Ethereum Mainnet, but can be
enabled on a per-chain basis or globally.

This might help to save gas on spikes. Chainlink nodes should react faster on
the upleg and avoid overpaying on the downleg. It might also be possible to
set `EVM.GasEstimator.BlockHistory.BatchSize` to a smaller value such as 12 or
even 6 because tip cap should be a more consistent indicator of inclusion time
than total gas price. This would make Chainlink nodes more responsive and
should reduce response time variance. Some experimentation is required to find
optimum settings.

Set with caution, if you set this on a chain that does not actually support
EIP-1559 your node will be broken.

In EIP-1559 mode, the total price for the transaction is the minimum of base
fee + tip cap and fee cap. More information can be found on the [official
EIP](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-1559.md).

Chainlink's implementation of EIP-1559 works as follows:

If you are using FixedPriceEstimator:

  * With gas bumping disabled, it will submit all transactions with `feecap=PriceMax` and `tipcap=GasTipCapDefault`
  * With gas bumping enabled, it will submit all transactions initially with `feecap=GasFeeCapDefault` and

with a random number, the amount of LINK token to be paid to the VRF can be dynamic based on network conditions. When demand to get transactions into a blockchain is high, and thus gas prices are high, more LINK will be deducted to compensate the gas the VRF has to pay to get it's random number transaction on-chain. Or if you don't want the contract to request random numbers when the gas price is high, you can specify that via the Gas Lane. The more random numbers the contract requests at once the more expensive it will be. And finally the higher the computational load of the function the consumer contract runs when recieving a random number; the more gas it will cost for the VRF to submit a random number.

The subscription model added in Chainlink VRFv2 is a powerful tool, enabling any consumer contract requesting a random number to determine how it wants that random number!

# Making flexible, secure, and low-cost contracts

  * Overview
  * Prerequisites
  * Problem: On-chain computation leads to high gas fees
  * Solution: Perform complex computations with no gas fees
  * Conclusion

In this guide, you will learn how the flexibility of [Chainlink
Automation](https://chain.link/automation) enables important design patterns
that reduce gas fees, enhance the resilience of dApps, and improve end-user
experience. Smart contracts themselves cannot self-trigger their functions at
arbitrary times or under arbitrary conditions. Transactions can only be
initiated by another account.

Start by integrating an example contract to Chainlink Automation that has not
yet been optimized. Then, deploy a comparison contract that shows you how to
properly use the flexibility of Chainlink Automation to perform complex
computations without paying high gas fees.

## Prerequisites

This guide assumes you have a basic understanding of [Chainlink
Automation](https://chain.link/keepers). If you are new to Keepers, complete
the following guides first:

  * Know how to [deploy solidity contracts using Remix and Metamask](/getting-started/deploy-your-first-contract)
  * Learn how to make [compatible contracts](/chainlink-automation/compatible-contracts)
  * [Register UpKeep for a Contract](/chainlink-automation/register-upkeep)

Chainlink Automation is supported on several [networks](/chainlink-automation/supported-networks).

ERC677 Link

  * Get [LINK](/resources/link-token-contracts) on the supported testnet that you want to use.
  * For funding on Mainnet, you need ERC-677 LINK. Many token bridges give you ERC-20 LINK tokens. Use PegSwap to [convert Chainlink tokens (LINK) to be ERC-677

counterpart.
For example, the exploitation or hack of a cross-chain token bridge may cause
a collapse in demand for a particular wrapped asset. As such, users should
construct their applications with safeguards, such as circuit breakers to
proactively pause functionality to mitigate risk during such scenarios.
Circuit breakers can be created using Chainlink Automation to monitor data
feeds for unexpected scenarios.

An additional mechanism for securing a protocol utilizing wrapped assets is by
incorporating [Chainlink Proof of Reserve](https://chain.link/proof-of-reserve). Chainlink Proof of Reserve enables the real-time reserve monitoring
of off-chain and cross-chain assets, including those that have been
wrapped/bridged. By comparing the wrapped token뗩 supply against a Chainlink
Proof of Reserve feed, protocols can ensure that these assets are properly
collateralized at all times.

### Front Running Risk

Front running (when a third party benefits from prior access to information
about a transaction) is a known risk inherent to specific blockchain
applications. Chainlink Data Feeds are optimized to prioritize high levels of
data quality and reliability over latency.

To mitigate the risk associated with front running, users building highly
latency-dependent applications should assess whether the configuration of data
feeds meets their needed specifications for speed and frequency.

### Fast Gas Reliability

The [Fast Gas Data Feed](https://data.chain.link/ethereum/mainnet/gas/fast-gas-gwei) provides a simple way to determine the price of gas so you can
estimate how much gas you need to make a transaction execute quickly. Fast gas
prices can be manipulated, so you should design your applications to detect
gas price volatility or malicious activity that might affect the costs of your
transactions.

Question Body:


In chainlink keepers document [here](https://docs.chain.link/docs/chainlink-
keepers/compatible-contracts/). There is a conf called `checkGasLimit` with
6,500,000 as the default value.

Since the computation in `checkUpKeep` is expected to be outsourced off-chain,
why there is a configuration called `checkGasLimit` where computation is off-
chain?

Or `checkGasLimit` is for the situation where function `checkUpKeep` is
supposed to modify some state.



Answers:
(Answered on: 2022-06-01 13:39:47)


You got it!

`checkUpkeep` can be used to change the state of the blockchain. The Chainlink
nodes will call the `checkUpkeep` function when it returns true - and if it
costs gas, it will use gas.

The use of the `checkGasLimit` then, is to make sure they don't use too much
gas. Per the docs:

`The maximum amount of gas that can be used by your checkUpkeep for off-chain
computation.`

  1. [Open the example contract](https://remix.ethereum.org/#url=https://docs.chain.link/samples/PriceFeeds/PriceConsumerV3.sol) in Remix. Remix opens and shows the contents of the smart contract.

[Open the contract in
Remix](https://remix.ethereum.org/#url=https://docs.chain.link/samples/PriceFeeds/PriceConsumerV3.sol)

  2. Because the code is already written, you can start the compile step. On the left side of Remix, click the **Solidity Compiler** tab to view the compiler settings.

  3. Use the default compiler settings. Click the **Compile PriceConsumerV3.sol** button to compile the contract. Remix automatically detects the correct compiler version depending on the `pragma` that you specify in the contract. You can ignore warnings about unused local variables in this example.

  4. On the **Deploy** tab, select the **Injected Provider** environment. This contract specifically requires Web3 because it connects with another contract on the blockchain. Running in a JavaScript VM will not work.

  5. Because the example contract has several imports, Remix might select another contract to deploy by default. In the **Contract** section, select the `PriceConsumerV3` contract to make sure that Remix deploys the correct contract.

  6. Click **Deploy** to deploy the contract to the Sepolia testnet. MetaMask opens and asks you to confirm payment for deploying the contract. Make sure MetaMask is set to the Sepolia network before you accept the transaction. Because these transactions are on the blockchain, they are not reversible.

  7. In the MetaMask prompt, click **Confirm** to approve the transaction and spend your testnet ETH required to deploy the contract.

  8. After a few seconds, the transaction completes and your contract appears under the **Deployed Contracts** list in Remix. Click the contract dropdown to view its variables and functions.

Question Body:


I've looked though all the other questions on this topic and no answers seem
to work, I have run npm i @chainlink/contracts. But still I can not import
these contracts. It works perfectly on remix but in vscode with hardhat,
nothing seems to fix it.

I had the same problem, red lines under the imports.

The solution was to change the VSCode Extension - Solidity by Juan Blanco - to

@chainlink=smartcontractkit/chainlink-brownie-contracts@1.1.1 to
@chainlink=smartcontractkit/chainlink-brownie-contracts@0.2.1 in the config
file of your project

# Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

  * Overview

Chainlink Nodes allow the root admin CLI user and any additional admin users
to create and assign tiers of role-based access to new users. These new API
users can able to log in to the Operator UI independently.

Each user has a specific role assigned to their account. There are four roles:
`admin`, `edit`, `run`, and `view`.

If there are multiple users who need specific access to manage the Chainlink
Node instance, permissions and level of access can be set here.

User management is configured through the use of the admin `chainlink admin
users` command. Run `chainlink admin login` before you set user roles for
other accounts. For example, a read-only user can be created with the
following command:


    chainlink admin users create --email=operator-ui-read-only@test.com --role=view

Specific actions are enabled to check role-based access before they execute.
The following table lists the actions that have role-based access and the role
that is required to run that action:

| Action                                        | Read   | Run   | Edit   | Admin   |

## Transfer funds from node wallet.

Note for Docker

If using Docker, you will first need to follow the Execute Commands Running
Docker guide to enter the running container.

To transfer funds from the node wallet to another address, use the following
CLI command:


    chainlink txs create <amount> <your-cl-node-address> <send-to-address>

This method is the preferred way to interact with your node wallet. Using
other methods to manually interact with the node wallet can cause nonce
issues.

chain --address ""0xEXAMPLE"" --evmChainID 99 --setEnabled true`
    * Disable a key for a particular chain: `chainlink evm keys chain --address ""0xEXAMPLE"" --evmChainID 99 --setEnabled false`
  * It is now possible to use the same key across multiple chains.

### Changed

  * The `chainlink admin users update` command is replaced with `chainlink admin users chrole`. Only the role can be changed for a user.
  * Keypath now supports paths with any depth, instead of limiting it to 2.
  * `Arbitrum` chains are no longer restricted to only `FixedPrice` `GAS_ESTIMATOR_MODE`.
  * Updated `Arbitrum Rinkeby & Mainnet` configurations for Nitro.

### Removed

  * The `setnextnonce` local client command is removed and is replaced by the more general `evm keys chain` command client command.

## Changes in v1.7.1 nodes

**[v1.7.1 release
notes](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/chainlink/releases/tag/v1.7.1)**

### Fixed

  * Arbitrum Nitro client error support

## Execute Commands Running Docker

In order to interact with the node's CLI commands, you need to be
authenticated. This means that you need to access a shell within the Chainlink
node's running container first. You can obtain the running container's `NAME`
by running:


    docker ps

The output will look similar to:


    CONTAINER ID        IMAGE                     COMMAND                  CREATED             STATUS              PORTS                              NAMES

The last item, `chainlink`, is the name of the running container (using
`--name chainlink` in your `docker run` command will give you a common name).
Accessing a shell for this container is accomplished by running:


    docker exec -it chainlink /bin/bash

This changes the prompt to something similar to:


    root@436882efd51d:~#

You can now log in by

### Stopping and removing the existing Chainlink node container

This process is required when you update the container to a newer release.


    docker stop chainlink && docker rm chainlink

### `fulfillRandomWords` function

`fulfillRandomWords` is a special function defined within the
`VRFConsumerBaseV2` contract that our contract extends from. The coordinator
sends the result of our generated `randomWords` back to `fulfillRandomWords`.
You will implement some functionality here to deal with the result:

  1. Change the result to a number between 1 and 20 inclusively. Note that `randomWords` is an array that could contain several random values. In this example, request 1 random value.

contract calls the _FunctionsBillingRegistry_ 's `fulfillAndBill` function to calculate the fulfillment costs and finalize the billing (To learn more, read [Cost calculation](/chainlink-functions/resources/billing#cost-calculation-fulfillment)).
  9. The _FunctionsBillingRegistry_ contract calls back the consumer contract.

**Note** : Chainlink Functions requests are not limited to API requests. The
diagram depicts an example of API requests, but you can request the DON to run
any computation.

## Subscription Management

Chainlink Functions requests receive funding from [subscription
accounts](/chainlink-functions/resources/concepts). As explained in
[Concepts](/chainlink-functions/resources/concepts), the _Subscription App_ is
a User Interface that abstracts the communications with the _Subscriptions
contract_ (aka _Functions Billing Registry_ contract). The _Functions Billing
Registry_ lets you manage your subscription accounts.

note

The _Subscriptions App_ is not available now, we recommend using the
[functions hardhat starter kit](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/functions-hardhat-starter-kit) to communicate with the [Functions Billing Registry
contract](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/chainlink/blob/develop/contracts/src/v0.8/dev/functions/FunctionsBillingRegistry.sol).

### Create Subscription

EOAs (Externally Owned Accounts) create subscriptions using the _Subscriptions
App_. The App communicates with the _Functions Billing Registry_ , which
assigns a unique identifier (aka _Subscription ID_ ).

### Fund Subscription

You must fund your subscription accounts with enough LINK tokens:

  1. Connect your EOA to the _Subscription App_.
  2. Fund your subscription account. The _Subscriptions App_ abstracts the following: 


:::NEXT DOC:::

 latestRequestId = assignedReqID;

`fulfillRequest` is invoked by Chainlink Functions during the callback. This
function is defined in `FunctionsClient` as `virtual` (read `fulfillRequest`
[API reference](/chainlink-functions/api-reference/FunctionsClient/#fulfillrequest)). So, your smart contract must
override the function to implement the callback. The implementation of the
callback is straightforward: the contract stores the latest response and error
in `latestResponse` and `latestError` and increments `responseCounter` before
emitting the `OCRResponse` event.


    latestResponse = response;
    latestError = err;
    responseCounter = responseCounter + 1;
    emit OCRResponse(requestId, response, err);

### `fulfillRandomWords` function

`fulfillRandomWords` is a special function defined within the
`VRFConsumerBaseV2` contract that our contract extends from. The coordinator
sends the result of our generated `randomWords` back to `fulfillRandomWords`.
You will implement some functionality here to deal with the result:

  1. Change the result to a number between 1 and 20 inclusively. Note that `randomWords` is an array that could contain several random values. In this example, request 1 random value.
  2. Assign the transformed value to the address in the `s_results` mapping variable.
  3. Emit a `DiceLanded` event.

and `times` parameters. These are read by the Tasks in the job to perform correctly. `get` is used by [HTTP](/chainlink-nodes/oracle-jobs/all-tasks/#http-task), `path` is used by [JSON Parse](/chainlink-nodes/oracle-jobs/all-tasks/#json-parse-task) and `times` is used by [Multiply](/chainlink-nodes/oracle-jobs/all-tasks/#multiply-task).
  3. `fulfill` function: This is where the result is sent upon the Oracle Job's completion.

**Note:** The calling contract should own enough LINK to pay the fee, which by
default is 0.1 LINK. You can use [this tutorial](/resources/fund-your-contract) to learn how to fund your contract.

This is an example of a basic HTTP GET request. However, it requires defining
the API URL directly in the smart contract. This can, in fact, be extracted
and configured on the Job level inside the Oracle node. You can follow the
_APIConsumer_ tutorial [here](/any-api/get-request/examples/single-word-response).

### External adapters

If all the parameters are defined within the Oracle job, the only things a
smart contract needs to define to consume are:

  * JobId
  * Oracle address
  * LINK fee
  * Fulfillment function

This will make your smart contract much more succinct. The `requestVolumeData`
function from the code example above would look more like this:


    function requestVolumeData() public returns (bytes32 requestId) {
        Chainlink.Request memory req = buildChainlinkRequest(jobId, address(this), this.fulfill.selector);
    
        // Extra parameters don't need to be defined here because they are already defined in the job
    
        return sendChainlinkRequest(req, fee);

the result back to your contract.
There might be multiple reasons, but most likely something is wrong when the
Chainlink node calls the function `fulfillOracleRequest2` in the
[Operator.sol](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/chainlink/blob/develop/contracts/src/v0.7/Operator.sol)
and fails to write the result back to your contract.

Please check the following:

  1. Check if you fund your Chainlink node. You can check the balance of the chainlink node in the top right of the Chainlink node UI which is usually with port number 6688(eg. http://localhost:6688). Because the Chainlink node changes the state of the blockchain when calling the function in the contract operator, there has to be a minimum balance of ETH remaining in your Chainlink node. The solution to the issue is just to transfer some ETH(not LINK) tokens to your chainlink node address. [](https://i.stack.imgur.com/nXWT5.jpg)

  2. Check if you grant the Chainlink node permission to call function `fulfillOracleRequest2` in the contract operator. Search your Chainlink node address in the blockchain explorer like [etherscan](https://etherscan.io/), [goerliscan](https://goerli.etherscan.io/), [polygonscan](https://polygonscan.com/), etc. and if the node has no permission to call function `fulfillOracleRequest`, error `Fail with error 'Not authorized sender'` will be thrown. The solution to the issue is to use the function `setAuthorizedSenders` to grant the node address permission to call the function `fulfillOracleRequest2`.

What is the benefit of using Off-Chain Reporting (OCR) for Chainlink oracle networks?,"Submitting only one transaction per round reduces overall network congestion, individual node operators spend less on gas costs, node networks are more scalable, and data feeds can be updated in a more timely manner.",{'source': 'https://docs.chain.link/architecture-overview/off-chain-reporting/'},"The benefit of using Off-Chain Reporting (OCR) for Chainlink oracle networks is that it reduces overall network congestion, individual node operators spend less on gas costs, node networks are more scalable, and data feeds can be updated in a more timely manner since each round needn't wait for multiple transactions to be confirmed before a price is confirmed on-chain. OCR allows nodes to aggregate their observations into a single report off-chain using a secure P2P network, which saves a significant amount of gas.","# Off-Chain Reporting

  * Overview
  * What is OCR?
  * How does OCR work?

Off-Chain Reporting (OCR) is a significant step towards increasing the
decentralization and scalability of Chainlink networks. See the [OCR Protocol
Paper](https://research.chain.link/ocr.pdf) for a technical deep dive.

For Off-Chain Reporting aggregators, all nodes communicate using a peer to
peer network. During the communication process, a lightweight consensus
algorithm runs where each node reports its data observation and signs it. A
single aggregate transaction is then transmitted, which saves a significant
amount of gas.

The report contained in the aggregate transaction is signed by a quorum of
oracles and contains all oracles' observations. By validating the report on-
chain and checking the quorum's signatures on-chain, we preserve the
trustlessness properties of Chainlink oracle networks.

## What is OCR?

A simple analogy

Imagine ordering 10 items from an online store. Each item is packaged
separately and posted separately, meaning postage and packaging costs must be
applied to each one, and the carrier has to transport 10 different boxes.

OCR, on the other hand, packages all of these items into a single box and
posts that. This saves postage and packaging fees and all effort the carrier
associates with transporting 9 fewer boxes.

The OCR protocol allows nodes to aggregate their observations into a single
report off-chain using a secure P2P network. A single node then submits a
transaction with the aggregated report to the chain. Each report consists of
many nodes' observations and has to be signed by a quorum of nodes. These
signatures are verified on-chain.

Submitting only one transaction per round achieves the following benefits:

  * Overall network congestion from Chainlink oracle networks is reduced dramatically
  * Individual node operators

transaction with the aggregated report to the chain. Each report consists of
many nodes' observations and has to be signed by a quorum of nodes. These
signatures are verified on-chain.

Submitting only one transaction per round achieves the following benefits:

  * Overall network congestion from Chainlink oracle networks is reduced dramatically
  * Individual node operators spend far less on gas costs
  * Node networks are more scalable because data feeds can accommodate more nodes
  * Data feeds can be updated in a more timely manner since each round needn't wait for multiple transactions to be confirmed before a price is confirmed on-chain.

## How does OCR work?

Protocol execution happens mostly off-chain over a peer to peer network
between Chainlink nodes. The nodes regularly elect a new leader node that
drives the rest of the protocol.

The leader regularly requests followers to provide freshly signed observations
and aggregates them into a report. It then sends this report back to the
followers and asks them to verify the report's validity. If a quorum of
followers approves the report by sending a signed copy back to the leader, the
leader assembles a final report with the quorum's signatures and broadcasts it
to all followers.

The nodes attempt to transmit the final report to the aggregator contract
according to a randomized schedule. The aggregator verifies that a quorum of
nodes signed the report and exposes the median value to consumers as an answer
with

aggregated, and how consumer
contracts can retrieve this data.

## Off-Chain Reporting

Off-Chain Reporting (OCR) is an improvement on the decentralization and
scalability of Chainlink networks. With our Off-Chain Reporting aggregators,
all nodes communicate using a peer to peer network. During the communication
process, a lightweight consensus algorithm runs where each node reports its
price observation and signs it. A single aggregate transaction is then
transmitted, which saves a significant amount of gas.

The current version of aggregation used is called ""OCR"" or ""Off-Chain
Reporting"". FluxAggregator was the previous aggregation method. The code and
contracts for OCR can be found in this repo:

<https://github.com/smartcontractkit/libocr>

Running your own feeds isn't officially supported _yet_ (this is being worked
on), so there isn't any documentation, but it is possible to run your own feed
using that code if you really need to. You could also aggregate a couple of
""[Chainlink AnyAPI](https://docs.chain.link/docs/make-a-http-get-request/)""
requests in your contract to simulate a feed.

If this is for a hackathon (or just to demo your app) and there's no existing
data feed for the data you need, I'd suggest using the ""AnyAPI"" feature and a
single Chainlink node, so you can focus on your application and not on
building an oracle network. Once it's time to go to production/mainnet, the
Chainlink Labs team can assist you in making a decentralized oracle network.
You can reach them here on the [Chainlink website](https://chain.link/data-
feeds).

# Data Feeds Architecture

  * Overview
  * Basic Request Model
  * Decentralized Data Model
  * Off-Chain Reporting

## Basic Request Model

Chainlink connects smart contracts with external data using its decentralized
oracle network. Chainlink API requests are handled 1:1 by an oracle.

The [Basic Request Model](/architecture-overview/architecture-request-model)
describes the on-chain architecture of requesting data from a single oracle
source.

To learn how to make a GET request using a single oracle, see [Make a GET
Request](/any-api/get-request/introduction).

## Decentralized Data Model

For a more robust and trustworthy answer, you can aggregate data from many
oracles. With on-chain aggregation, data is aggregated from a decentralized
network of independent oracle nodes. This architecture is applied to Chainlink
Data Feeds, which can aggregate data such as asset price data.

The [Decentralized Data Model](/architecture-overview/architecture-decentralized-model) describes how data is aggregated, and how consumer
contracts can retrieve this data.

## Off-Chain Reporting

Off-Chain Reporting (OCR) is an improvement on the decentralization and
scalability of Chainlink networks. With our Off-Chain Reporting aggregators,
all nodes communicate using a peer to peer network. During the communication
process, a lightweight consensus algorithm runs where each node reports its
price observation and signs it. A single aggregate transaction is then
transmitted, which saves a significant amount of gas.

run the computation off-chain. Finally, oracle nodes use the [Chainlink
OCR](/architecture-overview/off-chain-reporting) protocol to aggregate all the
responses before passing the aggregated responses to the consumer contracts in
callbacks. Note: As long as you use vanilla Node.js (no modules imports), you
can decentralize any computation you want such as API calls, computing maths
operations, etc.

## Decentralized Oracle Network (DON)

_Chainlink Functions_ are powered by a [Decentralized Oracle
Network](https://chain.link/education/blockchain-oracles#decentralized-oracles). The oracle nodes are independent of each other and are responsible
for running the same function such as API calls, computing maths operations,
etc. The nodes use the [Chainlink OCR](/architecture-overview/off-chain-reporting) protocol to aggregate all the nodes' responses. Finally, a DON's
oracle sends the aggregate response to the consumer contract in a callback.

## Subscriptions

  * Subscriptions App: A user interface that interacts with the _Subscriptions Contract_. **Note** : The _Subscriptions App_ is not available now, we recommend using the [functions hardhat starter kit](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/functions-hardhat-starter-kit) to interact with the _Subscriptions Contract_.
  * Subscriptions Contract (aka [Functions Billing Registry Contract](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/chainlink/blob/develop/contracts/src/v0.8/dev/functions/FunctionsBillingRegistry.sol)): The contract that holds user funds to pay for _Chainlink Functions_ requests.
  * subscription account: An account that holds LINK tokens and makes them available to fund requests to Chainlink DON. A _Subscription ID_ uniquely IDentifies each account.

Question: (Asked on: 2022-05-20 12:03:27)
Chainlink newbie doubts
URL: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/72318627/chainlink-newbie-doubts

Question Body:


I'm starting my studies about Chainlink this week and right now I'm trying to
fit all together before I continue my exploration of Chainlink docs. May be
you could help me in this task.

Could you confirm this understanding?

As I've already read, there are 3 models in Chainlink:

  * Decentralized Data Model with Flux Aggregator where the oracle smart contract receives prices report of crypto assets and aggregate them to offer this information to consumers. However, this model is being deprecated in favor of OCR, right?
  * The Off-Chain Reporting that aggregates the prices of crypto assets off-chain and send a single transaction to the oracle smart contract and this smart contract offer the median of prices to the consumers.
  * Basic Request Model where it is possible to call any Chainlink job. Typically, this job is a API calling with some transformations before the result is sent to the smart contract consumer.

If I'm not misunderstanding this basics concepts, I have some doubts:

  * The first two models, DDM and OCR, are only for assets' prices or they could be used for other kinds of data since exists oracles providing that data? If true, are there real examples of this kind of usage?
  * About the Basic Request Model, I feel like it is a centralized solution, I haven't seen any step of aggregation/conciliation, only one node responds and that is it. Is this understanding right or I'm missing something?
  * Another concept not clear yet: what is a Data Provider? I found out this page <https://market.link/search/data-providers> and seems like centralized providers of data, is that right?

  * Consumer
  * Proxy
  * Aggregator

This page describes how data aggregation is applied to produce Chainlink Data
Feeds and provides more insight as to how Data Feeds are updated.

## Data Aggregation

Each data feed is updated by multiple, independent Chainlink oracle operators.
The
[AccessControlledOffchainAggregator](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/libocr/blob/master/contract/AccessControlledOffchainAggregator.sol)
aggregates the data on-chain.

Off-Chain Reporting (OCR) further enhances the aggregation process. To learn
more about OCR and how it works, see the [Off-Chain Reporting](/architecture-overview/off-chain-reporting) page.

## Shared Data Resource

Each data feed is built and funded by the community of users who rely on
accurate, up-to-date data in their smart contracts. As more users rely on and
contribute to a data feed, the quality of the data feed improves. For this
reason, each data feed has its own properties depending on the needs of its
community of users.

## Decentralized Oracle Network

Each data feed is updated by a decentralized oracle network. Each oracle
operator is rewarded for publishing data. The number of oracles contributing
to each feed varies. In order for an update to take place, the data feed
aggregator contract must receive responses from a minimum number of oracles or
the latest answer will not be updated. You can see the minimum number of
oracles for the corresponding feed at
[data.chain.link](https://data.chain.link).

Each oracle in the set publishes data during an aggregation round. That data
is validated and aggregated by a smart contract, which forms the feed's

mostly off-chain over a peer to peer network
between Chainlink nodes. The nodes regularly elect a new leader node that
drives the rest of the protocol.

The leader regularly requests followers to provide freshly signed observations
and aggregates them into a report. It then sends this report back to the
followers and asks them to verify the report's validity. If a quorum of
followers approves the report by sending a signed copy back to the leader, the
leader assembles a final report with the quorum's signatures and broadcasts it
to all followers.

The nodes attempt to transmit the final report to the aggregator contract
according to a randomized schedule. The aggregator verifies that a quorum of
nodes signed the report and exposes the median value to consumers as an answer
with a block timestamp and a round ID.

All nodes watch the blockchain for the final report to remove any single point
of failure during transmission. If the designated node fails to get their
transmission confirmed within a determined period, a round-robin protocol
kicks in so other nodes can also transmit the final report until one of them
is confirmed.

## Off-chain reporting jobs

OCR jobs (off-chain reporting jobs) are used very similarly to Flux Monitor
jobs. They update data feeds with aggregated data from many Chainlink oracle
nodes. However, they do this aggregation using a cryptographically-secure off-
chain protocol that makes it possible for only a single node to submit all
answers from all participating nodes during each round (with proofs that the
other nodes' answers were legitimately provided by those nodes), which saves a
significant amount of gas.

Off-chain reporting jobs require the `FEATURE_OFFCHAIN_REPORTING=true`
environment variable.

### Bootstrap node

Every OCR cluster requires at least one bootstrap node as a kind of ""rallying
point"" that enables the other nodes to find one another. Bootstrap nodes do
not participate in the aggregation protocol and do not submit answers to the
feed.

  * Overview

External initiators allow jobs in a node to be initiated depending on some
external condition. The ability to create and add external initiators to
Chainlink nodes enables blockchain agnostic cross-chain compatibility.

note

At this time of writing, external initiators do not show up in the bridges
tab. However, they act exactly the same as if they did.

note

External initiators are disabled on nodes by default. Set the
`FEATURE_EXTERNAL_INITIATORS=true` [configuration variable](/chainlink-nodes/v1/configuration/#feature_external_initiators) to enable this feature.

Initiator Bridges handle the authentication to and from the External Initiator
and where to send the messages. When creating a Bridge two parameters are
required:

Only the [webhook](/chainlink-nodes/oracle-jobs/all-jobs/#webhook-jobs) job
type can be initiated using an External Initiator.

The external initiator must be created before the webhook job, and must be
referenced by name (whitelisted) in order for that external initiator to be
allowed to trigger the given webhook job.

When the External Initiator is created it generates two pairs of credentials:
Outgoing and Incoming. The Outgoing Access Key and Secret are used to
authenticate messages sent from the Core to the External Initiator. The
Incoming Access Key and Secret are used to authenticate messages sent from the
External Initiator to the Core.

Then, once you've created the name, bridge, and have the correct access keys
for the URL, you can proceed to use the external initiator as if it's a
regular initiator in future job specs.

repo for
reference. You can see some examples of existing initiators in the
[blockchain](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/external-initiator/tree/master/blockchain) folder.

External initiators are simple web initiators that can be activated by any job
instead of just one. To set one up, you need to have a service similar to an
external adapter that sends an `HTTPPost` message runs API call to your
chainlink node service. Here is a sample URL for a web job could look like:


    curl -b cookiefile -X POST -H ""Content-Type: application/json"" --data '{""myKey"":""myVal""}' http://localhost:6688/v2/jobs/%s/runs

Where `%s` is the jobId.

External initiators make the same API call, with 2 added headers:

  1. ""X-Chainlink-EA-AccessKey""
  2. ""X-Chainlink-EA-Secret""

These are keys generated when you register your external initiator with your
node.

Triggering a run through an external initiator is as simple as making this API
call to your node. All jobs with this EI configured will then be kicked off in
this way. A simple external initiator in psedo code could look like this:


    while(True):
        send_api_call_with_external_initiator_access_key_headers()
        sleep(4)

And have this job run on the same machine as your node.

You need to make sure you have the `FEATURE_EXTERNAL_INITIATORS` environment
variable set to true in your .env file as such:

`FEATURE_EXTERNAL_INITIATORS=true`

This will open up access to the `initiators` command in the Chainlink CLI and
you can resume the instructions from there.

# Adding External Initiators to Nodes

  * Overview
  * Creating an external initiator
  * Deleting an external initiator
  * Listing external initiators

note

External initiators are disabled on nodes by default. Set the
`FEATURE_EXTERNAL_INITIATORS=true` [configuration variable](/chainlink-nodes/v1/configuration/#feature_external_initiators) to enable this feature.

## Creating an external initiator

To create an external initiator you must use the remote API. You can do this
yourself, like so:


    POST http://<your chainlink node>/v2/external_initiators -d <PAYLOAD>

where payload is a JSON blob that contains:


    {
      ""name"": <MANDATORY UNIQUE NAME>,
      ""url"": <OPTIONAL EXTERNAL INITIATOR URL>
    }

If a URL is provided, Chainlink will notify this URL of added and deleted jobs
that can be triggered by this external initiator. This allows the external
initiator to program in certain actions e.g. subscribing/unsubscribing to logs
based on the job, etc.

On creation:


    POST <URL> -d {""jobId"": <job external UUID>, ""type"": <name of external initiator>, ""params"": <optional arbitrary JSON specified at job creation time>}

On deletion:


    DELETE <URL>/<job external UUID>

You can use the chainlink client for convenience to access this API.

Enter the [Chainlink nodes CLI](/chainlink-nodes/resources/miscellaneous/#execute-commands-running-docker) and run the
following command


    chainlink initiators create <NAME> <URL>

`NAME`: The name you want to use

:::NEXT DOC:::

EI and then checking to see if a sample job kicks off is the best way to
test this.

To try a real-life example, feel free to follow along with the [Conflux EI
demo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8oJEp4qz5w).

Additional external initiator reference

note

The External Initiator can only initiate [webhook jobs](/chainlink-nodes/oracle-jobs/job-types/webhook) that have been linked to it. Trying to
initiate a job that is not linked will give an unauthorised error.

## Deleting an external initiator

To delete an external initiator you must use the remote API. You can do this
yourself, like so:


    DELETE http://<your chainlink node>/v2/external_initiators/<external initiator name>

You can alternatively use the chainlink client for convenience:


    chainlink initiators destroy <NAME>

## Listing external initiators

To see your installed external initiators:


    GET http://<your chainlink node>/v2/external_initiators?size=100&page=1

Or, using the chainlink client:

chain controlled
by the user.

Web2 verification can be fairly convenient for personal transactions and
requires less technical expertise. However, it is limited only to swapping and
bridging tokens which requires trust in a centralized custodian.

#### External verification

External verification is where a group of validator nodes are responsible for
verifying transactions. These validators do not belong to either of the two
blockchains validator sets and they also have their trust assumptions
irrespective of the underlying blockchains.

External verification typically requires an honest majority assumption, where
a majority of the external validator nodes must behave honestly for the
integrity of the cross-chain interaction to be upheld. However, additional
techniques can be used to increase trust-minimization, such as:

  * optimistic bridge verification.
  * anti-fraud networks.
  * cryptoeconomic staking.

Despite an additional trust assumption, external verification is currently the
only practical way to perform cross-chain contract calls between certain types
of blockchains while still providing trust-minimized guarantees. It뗩 also a
highly generalized and extensible form of cross-chain computation that is
capable of supporting more complex cross-chain applications.

Cryptography risk

Some externally verified bridges are secured by multisig wallets.
[Ronin](https://whitepaper.axieinfinity.com/technology/ronin-ethereum-sidechain) is one example. Multisig wallets are also referred to as m-of-n
multisigs, with M being the required number of signatures or keys and N being
the total number of signatures or keys (m곣n). This means that an attacker only
needs to exploit M keys to be able to hack the whole system. In this case,
users must trust that the third party is decentralized enough, signers are
independent of each other, and that each signer has proper key management in
place. Read this [detailed

Question: (Asked on: 2022-09-12 20:50:02)
Convert uint value from chainlink VRF to boolean SOLIDITY
URL: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/73695116/convert-uint-value-from-chainlink-vrf-to-boolean-solidity

Question Body:


I am writing a coin toss contract using Chainlink VRF to request a random
number. When using chainlink, the random number generated is a uint. I am
trying to convert such uint into a boolean value to obtain whether 0 for heads
or 1 for tails.

I have already managed to obtain the random number and transform it into 0 or
1 using modulo (%). But the number I get is still a uint. How can I convert it
to a boolean value?

    
    
            struct round {
               uint roundId;
               uint betAmount;
               bool playerChoice; // 0 = heads; 1 = tails
               bool draw;
               bool win; 
            }
        
            function fulfillRandomWords(
                uint256, /* requestId */
                uint256[] memory randomWords
            ) internal override {
    
    // this where I get the error ""TypeError: Type uint256 is not implicitly convertible to expected type bool.""

a value. For nested mappings, we have boxes with labels (the addresses); inside each box, there are more little boxes using a uint as a label. If we open one of them, we will find a boolean.

To set the value of a nested array, we must provide the address and the uint which works like an index.

<Highlight class=""language-javascript"">
function set(address \_address, uint \_index, bool \_foo) public {
  nestedMapping[\_address][\_index] = \_foo;
}
</Highlight>

Retrieving a value works just as easy. We only need to provide the two keys (\_address and \_index):

<Highlight class=""language-javascript"">
function get(address \_address, uint \_index) public view returns (bool) {
  return nestedMapping[\_address][\_index];
}
</Highlight>

The same rules as for non-nested mappings apply here. We do not need to define a get function for nested functions. Solidity does this for us. And if the value does exist, we will simply get a default value.

on those numbers.
* bool: Booleans (0 or 1)
    * A boolean is a variable that can only be 0 or 1. You can also think of these as false (0) and true (1).
* address: An Account Address (0xa345643f1.e13)
    * An address represents an accout on Ethereum as a hexadecimal number beginning with 0x. These can be wallet accounts (also known as Externally Owned Accounts or EOAs) or contract accounts (the address where contracts can be found on the blockchain).

There are more but we can learn more about them later, these are the major ones for now! Once a variable is assigned a type, it뗩 type can뗪 change.

An example variable declaration would be: 

<Highlight class=""language-javascript"">
uint myFavNum;
</Highlight>

This creates a variable called 랈yFavNum and assigns it the type uint, or unsigned integer. Now we can use myFavoriteNumber to store numbers like 0,1,2,3,4뵨tc. in our contract.

You can compare the resulting value with 0 or 1.

    
    
    // comparison returns a bool
    myRound.draw = (randomWords[0] % 2) == 1;

value of `market` should be a `byets32` reprsenting ""CCCAGG"" as shown in
the API. But what I got was just `0x0...00` all the time, which means `market`
has not been modified yet. I've checked this various ways and found out that
the `fulfill` function never get rans. Then same thing happens when I changed
the `jobId` and `oracle` to handle `get-> int256`, `get -> bool` (of course I
did change the return type of the variable such that it's consistent with the
returning form of API). I also noticed that only the job `get -> uint256`
works well (the example from documentation also used this job). Does anyon
know why? Was my code wrong or the problem came from the node/job? Since I was
able the get the example right, I don't think the problem cam from my wallet.

Any help would be appreciated!

You can test with a GET>STRING JOB

  1. Go to this link: <https://docs.chain.link/docs/any-api-testnet-oracles/>
  2. Take the Oracle contract address relevant to your network. For instance: 0xCC79157eb46F5624204f47AB42b3906cAA40eaB7 for Goerli
  3. Use a Get>String job: 7d80a6386ef543a3abb52817f6707e3b

Make sure that your callback function expects to receive a string. (see a full
example here: <https://docs.chain.link/docs/api-array-response/>)

Client Contract:

The contract you are building must import and inherit the client contract. It allows your contract to send the proper requests and receive answers from the Chainlink VRF. To send requests it allows your contract to utilize a function called RequestRandomness. To receive answers your contract will need to have a FulfillRandomness function. To import the Client Contract you need only one line at the top of your Solidity code:

<Highlight class=""language-javascript"">
import ""@chainlink/contracts/src/v0.8/VRFConsumerBaseV2.sol"";
</Highlight>

And to inherit the contract you must put the following when naming your contract:

<Highlight class=""language-javascript"">
contract VRFv2Consumer is VRFConsumerBaseV2
</Highlight>

VRF Coordinator Contract:

The Coordinator contract has two main duties. Manage subscriptions to the Chainlink VRF and verify every random number alongside its proof. A VRF subscription represents a contract that wants to receive a random number, how many random numbers it wants to receive, and how many LINK tokens have been pre-paid for that contact (as for every Chainlink service LINK tokens are used to pay the Chainlink VRF for every random number requested). So it essentially coordinates the random numbers sent out by Chainlink VRF!

or Service Level Agreements.

What makes a digital agreement different from a regular agreement or contractual agreement? Well theyre like regular agreements.but in a digital format. These agreements can be enforced in a court of law under certain circumstances. However, this doesn뗪 often happen due to the costs of going to court coupled with the low value these contracts represent for individual consumers.

Customers also tend not to read these agreements due to lengthy, complex legalese. Oftentimes digital agreements give consumers very little recourse at all! Due to these reasons, the power of digital agreements is heavily skewed towards the institutions who create them rather than being a fair, equitable agreement between institutions and their consumers. A prime example of this is the <a style=""color:blue"" href=""https://www.jama.work/blog/on-robinhood-and-availability""> Robinhood Gamestop downtime incident</a>.

  * Overview

This guide will walk you through how to generate your own self-signed
certificates for use by the Chainlink node. You can also substitute self-
signed certificates with certificates of your own, like those created by
[Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/).

You will need [OpenSSL](https://www.openssl.org) in order to generate your own
self-signed certificates.

Create a directory `tls/` within your local Chainlink directory:

**TLDR:** The basic example from the [docs](https://docs.chain.link) is
nothing but a building block of how to do it. It's an example of pulling from
a single API through a single node. To make this decentralized, you'd have to
pull many APIs through many different nodes.

The Chainlink Any API call feature should be considered the bare bones of a
Chainlink node. One piece of the whole picture. Analogously, a single Ethereum
node processing transactions would be centralized, and a single Chainlink node
responding with API data would be as well.

So we need many Ethereum nodes to process transactions to verify the
transactions are being processed correctly and many Chainlink nodes to verify
the data are being processed correctly. So if you want to get data through
Chainlink, you should use many nodes, and ideally many different data sources
as well - and that's how you can verify the data is correct.

       printf ""[dn]\nCN=localhost\n[req]\ndistinguished_name = dn\n[EXT]\nsubjectAltName=DNS:localhost\nkeyUsage=digitalSignature\nextendedKeyUsage=serverAuth"")

Next, add the `TLS_CERT_PATH` and `TLS_KEY_PATH` environment variables to your

    echo ""TLS_CERT_PATH=/chainlink/tls/server.crt

If `CHAINLINK_TLS_PORT=0` is present in your `.env` file, remove it by
running:


    sed -i '/CHAINLINK_TLS_PORT=0/d' .env

Also remove the line that disables `SECURE_COOKIES` by running:

Question Body:


i'd like to work with the chainlink v2 api to automatically adding jobs after
creating a chainlink node. using curl this works well for health

    
    
    curl localhost:6688/health
    

but not for protected endpoints like

    
    
    curl localhost:6688/v2/jobs
    

which returns {""errors"":[{""detail"":""Authentication failed""}]}

what is the auth implemented for the chainlink node? tried basic auth with
curl using the node admin credentials which didn't help...



Answers:
(Answered on: 2021-11-17 17:37:19)


chainlink node auth can be done via sessions.

  1. use curl with session endpoint to create cookie
  2. use the cookie to authorize endpoint access

to create a cookie in file ./cookie

    
    
    export USERNAME=<chainlink admin user name>
    export PASSWORD=<chainlink admin user password>
    curl -c ./cookie -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{""email"":""'${USERNAME}'"", ""PASSWORD"":""'${PASSWORD}'""}' localhost:6688/sessions
    

the cookie can now be used to access protected api endpoints

    
    
    curl -b ./cookie -c ./cookie localhost:6688/v2/jobs

Blockchains are deterministic, meaning that any computations that use blockchains must have predictable outcomes. This so all of the nodes that run the blockchain can come to an agreement on what the blockchain is. But deterministic runs counter to random. If everyone knows what the next hand of poker will be before it is dealt it wouldn뗪 be considered random. So if randomness is impossible on a blockchain, how can we bring the awesome powers of smart contracts to any applications that need randomness?

We could get the randomness from an outside resource! But it can뗪 be a trusted centralized service (as discussed in Chainlink 101), or we would be ruining the decentralized properties of blockchains and smart contracts. And it would be great if it could be verified that the number wasn뗪 tampered with and is genuinely random. This is a perfect example of where a decentralized oracle network powered by Chainlink could be used!

Ideally, you'd not want to put your API keys on-chain at all, but here are
your options for working with sensitive data with a Chainlink oracle.

## 1\. Pass your API key to a node operator

This of course, this a trusted operation since you'll have to trust the node
operator with your key. However, this will prevent the world from seeing your
key, and the node operator can just use it on the backend.

## 2\. Encrypt your key before you use it

You'll will still need to give the Chainlink node operators a way to decrypt
the data on the back end, and this is considered less safe because you're
still giving people a way to access your data, and you're putting it on-chain.

## 3\. Make a protected API that can only be called by node operators.

So you'd run an API that wraps around another API.

## 4\. DECO (not live yet)

There are plans to have DECO come out at some time which will help keep
private data safe even from Chainlink node operators.

## Comparing VRF v1 to the VRF v2 subscription method

Chainlink VRF v2 includes several improvements and changes to the way you fund
and request randomness for your smart contracts.

  * **Subscription management:** Chainlink VRF v2 introduces a [Subscription Manager](/vrf/v2/subscription/ui) application that allows smart contract applications to pre-fund multiple requests for randomness using a single LINK token balance. This reduces the gas fees for VRF requests by eliminating the need to transfer LINK tokens for each individual request. You transfer LINK tokens to the subscription balance only when it requires additional funding. Read the [Subscription Manager](/vrf/v2/subscription/ui) page to learn more.

  * **Variable Callback Gas Limit:** Chainlink VRF v2 lets you adjust the callback gas limit when your smart contract application receives verifiable randomness. Consuming contracts can execute more complex logic in the callback request function that receives the random values. Tasks involving the delivered randomness are handled during the response process. The new gas limits are higher than the VRF V1 limit, and vary depending on the underlying blockchain you use. See the gas limits on the [VRF Supported Networks](/vrf/v2/subscription/supported-networks) page.

To learn how to request random numbers with a subscription, see the
[Subscription Method](/vrf/v2/subscription/) guide.

Security Considerations

Be sure to review your contracts with the [security
considerations](/vrf/v2/security/) in mind.

## Comparison between VRF v1 and VRF v2 (Direct funding method)

The main similarity between VRF v1 and VRF v2 Direct funding method is that
consuming contracts must be funded with LINK to pay for requests. However,
Chainlink VRF v2 includes several improvements.

  * **Variable Callback Gas Limit:** Chainlink VRF v2 lets you adjust the callback gas limit when your smart contract application receives verifiable randomness. Consuming contracts can execute more complex logic in the callback request function that receives the random values. Tasks involving the delivered randomness are handled during the response process. The new gas limits are higher than the VRF V1 limit, and vary depending on the underlying blockchain that you use. See the gas limits on the [Supported networks](/vrf/v2/direct-funding/supported-networks) page.

  * **More configuration capability:** You can define how many block confirmations must pass before verifiable randomness is generated and delivered on-chain when your application makes a request transaction. The range is from 3 to 200 blocks. VRF V1 always waited 10 blocks on Ethereum before delivering on-chain randomness. Select a value that protects your application from block re-organizations while still providing sufficiently low latency from request to response. See the [Security Considerations](/vrf/v2/security) page to learn more.

page to learn more.

  * **Multiple Random Outputs in a Single Request:** The [VRF Coordinator contracts](/vrf/v2/subscription/supported-networks) in VRF v2 allow you to request multiple random numbers (multi-word) in a single on-chain transaction, which reduces gas costs. The fulfillment is also a single transaction, which reduces the latency of responses.

  * **Unified Billing - Delegate Subscription Balance to Multiple Addresses:** Chainlink VRF v2 allows up to 100 smart contract addresses to fund their requests for verifiable randomness from a single LINK subscription balance, which is managed by the subscription owner.

# Introduction to Chainlink VRF

  * Choosing the correct method
  * Supported networks

Get Started

Access verified randomness at [vrf.chain.link](https://vrf.chain.link).

**Chainlink VRF (Verifiable Random Function)** is a provably fair and
verifiable random number generator (RNG) that enables smart contracts to
access random values without compromising security or usability. For each
request, Chainlink VRF generates one or more random values and cryptographic
proof of how those values were determined. The proof is published and verified
on-chain before any consuming applications can use it. This process ensures
that results cannot be tampered with or manipulated by any single entity
including oracle operators, miners, users, or smart contract developers.

Security Considerations

Be sure to review your contracts with the [security
considerations](/vrf/v2/security/) in mind.

Use Chainlink VRF to build reliable smart contracts for any applications that
rely on unpredictable outcomes:

  * Building blockchain games and NFTs.
  * Random assignment of duties and resources. For example, randomly assigning judges to cases.
  * Choosing a representative sample for consensus mechanisms.

Be sure to review your contracts with the [security

## Comparison between VRF v1 and VRF v2 (Direct funding method)

The main similarity between VRF v1 and VRF v2 Direct funding method is that
consuming contracts must be funded with LINK to pay for requests. However,
Chainlink VRF v2 includes several improvements.

  * **Variable Callback Gas Limit:** Chainlink VRF v2 lets you adjust the callback gas limit when your smart contract application receives verifiable randomness. Consuming contracts can execute more complex logic in the callback request function that receives the random values. Tasks involving the delivered randomness are handled during the response process. The new gas limits are higher than the VRF V1 limit, and vary depending on the underlying blockchain that you use. See the gas limits on the [Supported networks](/vrf/v2/direct-funding/supported-networks) page.

  * **More configuration capability:** You can define how many block confirmations must pass before verifiable randomness is generated and delivered on-chain when your application makes a request transaction. The range is from 3 to 200 blocks. VRF V1 always waited 10 blocks on Ethereum before delivering on-chain randomness. Select a value that protects your application from block re-organizations while still providing sufficiently low latency from request to response. See the [Security Considerations](/vrf/v2/security) page to learn more.

## Comparing VRF v1 to the VRF v2 subscription method

Chainlink VRF v2 includes several improvements and changes to the way you fund
and request randomness for your smart contracts.

  * **Subscription management:** Chainlink VRF v2 introduces a [Subscription Manager](/vrf/v2/subscription/ui) application that allows smart contract applications to pre-fund multiple requests for randomness using a single LINK token balance. This reduces the gas fees for VRF requests by eliminating the need to transfer LINK tokens for each individual request. You transfer LINK tokens to the subscription balance only when it requires additional funding. Read the [Subscription Manager](/vrf/v2/subscription/ui) page to learn more.

  * **Variable Callback Gas Limit:** Chainlink VRF v2 lets you adjust the callback gas limit when your smart contract application receives verifiable randomness. Consuming contracts can execute more complex logic in the callback request function that receives the random values. Tasks involving the delivered randomness are handled during the response process.

To learn how to request random numbers with a subscription, see the
[Subscription Method](/vrf/v2/subscription/) guide.

Security Considerations

Be sure to review your contracts with the [security
considerations](/vrf/v2/security/) in mind.

This guide explains how to generate random numbers using the _direct funding_
method. This method doesn't require a subscription and is optimal for one-off
requests for randomness. This method also works best for applications where
your end-users must pay the fees for VRF because the cost of the request is
determined at request time.

## VRF direct funding

Unlike the [subscription method](/vrf/v2/subscription), the direct funding
method does not require you to create subscriptions and pre-fund them.
Instead, you must directly fund consuming contracts with LINK tokens before
they request randomness. Because the consuming contract directly pays the LINK
for the request, the cost is calculated during the request and not during the
callback when the randomness is fulfilled. Learn [how to estimate
costs](/vrf/v2/estimating-costs).

## Request and receive data

Requests to Chainlink VRF v2 follow the request and receive data cycle. This
end-to-end diagram shows each step in the lifecycle of a VRF direct funding
request:

Two types of accounts exist in the Ethereum ecosystem, and both are used in
VRF:

  * EOA (Externally Owned Account): An externally owned account that has a private key and can control a smart contract. Transactions can be initiated only by EOAs.
  * Smart contract: A smart contract that does not have a private key and executes what it has been designed

  * Smart contract: A smart contract that does not have a private key and executes what it has been designed for as a decentralized application.

The Chainlink VRF v2 solution uses both off-chain and on-chain components:

  * [VRF v2 Wrapper (on-chain component)](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/chainlink/blob/develop/contracts/src/v0.8/vrf/VRFV2Wrapper.sol): A wrapper for the VRF Coordinator that provides an interface for consuming contracts.
  * [VRF v2 Coordinator (on-chain component)](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/chainlink/blob/develop/contracts/src/v0.8/vrf/VRFCoordinatorV2.sol): A contract designed to interact with the VRF service. It emits an event when a request for randomness is made, and then verifies the random number and proof of how it was generated by the VRF service.
  * VRF service (off-chain component): Listens for requests by subscribing to the VRF Coordinator event logs and calculates a random number based on the block hash and nonce. The VRF service then sends a transaction to the `VRFCoordinator` including the random number and a proof of how it was

specific use case, [contact us](https://chain.link/contact) to connect with
one of our Solutions Architects. You can also ask questions about Chainlink
VRF on [Stack
Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/ask?tags=chainlink).

## Two methods to request randomness

Chainlink VRF v2 offers two methods for requesting randomness:

  * [Subscription](/vrf/v2/subscription): Create a subscription account and fund its balance with LINK tokens. Users can then connect multiple consuming contracts to the subscription account. When the consuming contracts request randomness, the transaction costs are calculated after the randomness requests are fulfilled and the subscription balance is deducted accordingly. This method allows you to fund requests for multiple consumer contracts from a single subscription.
  * [Direct funding](/vrf/v2/direct-funding): Consuming contracts directly pay with LINK when they request random values. You must directly fund your consumer contracts and ensure that there are enough LINK tokens to pay for randomness requests.

## Choosing the correct method

Depending on your use case, one method might be more suitable than another.
Consider the following characteristics when you choose a method:

| Subscription method

  * **Multiple Random Outputs in a Single Request:** The [VRF Coordinator contracts](/vrf/v2/subscription/supported-networks) in VRF v2 allow you to request multiple random numbers (multi-word) in a single on-chain transaction, which reduces gas costs. The fulfillment is also a single transaction, which reduces the latency of responses.

  * **Unified Billing - Delegate Subscription Balance to Multiple Addresses:** Chainlink VRF v2 allows up to 100 smart contract addresses to fund their requests for verifiable randomness from a single LINK subscription balance, which is managed by the subscription owner.

Chainlink Functions provides your smart contracts with access to a trust-
minimized compute infrastructure. Your smart contract sends your code to a
[Decentralized Oracle Network (DON)](/chainlink-functions/resources/concepts),
and each DON's oracle runs the same code in a serverless environment. The DON
aggregates all the independent runs and returns the final result to your smart
contract. Your code can be anything from simple computation to fetching data
from API providers.

Chainlink Functions provides access to off-chain computation without having to
run and configure your own Chainlink Node. To pay for requests, you fund a
subscription account with LINK. Your subscription is billed only when the DON
fulfills your request.

# Chainlink Functions Concepts

  * Overview
  * Request and Receive Data
  * Decentralized Oracle Network (DON)
  * Subscriptions

_Chainlink Functions_ do not require your consumer contracts to hold LINK
tokens and send them to oracles when making requests. Instead, you must create
a subscription account and fund it to pre-pay for your _Chainlink Functions_
requests, so your consumer contracts don't need to hold LINK when calling
_Chainlink Functions_.

Before you explore how Chainlink Functions works in the
[Architecture](/chainlink-functions/resources/architecture) guide, it is best
to understand the core concepts in this guide.

## Request and Receive Data

This model is similar to the [Basic Request Model](/architecture-overview/architecture-request-model): Consumer contracts initiate the cycle by
creating requests to Functions Oracle contracts. Oracle nodes watch for events
emitted by the [Functions Oracle
contract](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/chainlink/blob/develop/contracts/src/v0.8/dev/functions/FunctionsOracle.sol)
and run the computation off-chain. Finally, oracle nodes use the [Chainlink
OCR](/architecture-overview/off-chain-reporting) protocol to aggregate all the
responses before passing the aggregated responses to the consumer contracts in
callbacks. Note: As long as you use vanilla Node.js (no modules imports), you
can decentralize any computation you want such as API calls, computing maths
operations, etc.

## Decentralized Oracle Network (DON)

_Chainlink Functions_ are powered by a [Decentralized Oracle
Network](https://chain.link/education/blockchain-oracles#decentralized-oracles). The oracle nodes are independent of each other and are responsible
for running the same function such as API calls, computing maths

What is the purpose of the AggregatorV3Interface contract?,"The AggregatorV3Interface contract is used to get data from a specific round or the latest round of an aggregator, and to get the number of decimals and description of the aggregator.",{'source': 'https://docs.chain.link/data-feeds/api-reference/'},The purpose of the AggregatorV3Interface contract is to retrieve data feeds through the proxy address and to run functions in the proxy contract. It is used to get information about the aggregator behind the proxy.,"# Data Feeds API Reference

  * Overview
  * AggregatorV3Interface
  * Functions in AggregatorV3Interface
  * AccessControlledOffchainAggregator
  * Variables and functions in AccessControlledOffchainAggregator

When you use data feeds, retrieve the feeds through the
`AggregatorV3Interface` and the proxy address. Optionally, you can call
variables and functions in the `AccessControlledOffchainAggregator` contract
to get information about the aggregator behind the proxy.

## AggregatorV3Interface

Import this interface to your contract and use it to run functions in the
proxy contract. Create the interface object by pointing to the proxy address.
For example, on Sepolia you could create the interface object in the
constructor of your contract using the following example:


    /**
     * Network: Sepolia
     * Data Feed: ETH/USD
     * Address: 0x694AA1769357215DE4FAC081bf1f309aDC325306
     */
    constructor() {
      priceFeed = AggregatorV3Interface(0x694AA1769357215DE4FAC081bf1f309aDC325306);
    }
    

To see examples for how to use this interface, read the [Using Data
Feeds](/data-feeds/price-feeds) guide.

You can see the code for the [`AggregatorV3Interface`
contract](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/chainlink/blob/master/contracts/src/v0.8/interfaces/AggregatorV3Interface.sol)
on GitHub.

### Functions in AggregatorV3Interface

so you can use the
[AggregatorV3Interface.sol](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/chainlink/blob/master/contracts/src/v0.8/interfaces/AggregatorV3Interface.sol)
contract to retrieve price answers.

To learn more, see the [NFT Floor Price Feeds](/data-feeds/nft-floor-price)
documentation.

See the [NFT Floor Price Contract Addresses](/data-feeds/nft-floor-price/addresses) page for a list of available networks and addresses.

### Rate and Volatility Feeds

Several feeds provide interest rate curve data, APY data, and realized asset
price volatility.

To learn more, see the [Rate and Volatility Feeds](/data-feeds/rates-feeds)
documentation.

See the [Rate and Volatility Contract Addresses](/data-feeds/rates-feeds/addresses) page for a list of available networks and addresses.

### L2 sequencer uptime feeds

L2 sequencer feeds track the last known status of the sequencer on an L2
network at a given point in time. This helps you prevent mass liquidations by
providing a grace period to allow customers to react to these events.

To learn how to use L2 sequencer uptime feeds feeds, see the [L2 Sequencer
Uptime Feeds](/data-feeds/l2-sequencer-feeds) documentation.

## Components of a data feed

Data Feeds are an example of a decentralized oracle network and include the
following components:

  * **Consumer** : A consumer is an on-chain or off-chain application that uses Data Feeds. Consumer contracts use the [`AggregatorV3Interface`](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/chainlink/blob/master/contracts/src/v0.8/interfaces/AggregatorV3Interface.sol) to call functions on the proxy contract and retrieve information from the

:::NEXT DOC:::

are on-chain proxies that point to the aggregator for a
particular data feed. Using proxies enables the underlying aggregator to be
upgraded without any service interruption to consuming contracts.

Proxy contracts can vary from one data feed to another, but the
[`AggregatorProxy.sol`
contract](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/chainlink/blob/develop/contracts/src/v0.7/dev/AggregatorProxy.sol)
on Github is a common example.

### Aggregator

An aggregator is the contract that receives periodic data updates from the
oracle network. Aggregators store aggregated data on-chain so that consumers
can retrieve it and act upon it within the same transaction.

You can access this data using the Data Feed address and the
[`AggregatorV3Interface`
contract](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/chainlink/blob/develop/contracts/src/v0.6/interfaces/AggregatorV3Interface.sol).

Aggregators receive updates from the oracle network only when the **Deviation
Threshold** or **Heartbeat Threshold** triggers an update during an
aggregation round. The first condition that is met triggers an update to the
data.

  * Deviation Threshold: A new aggregation round starts when a node identifies that the off-chain values deviate by more than the defined deviation threshold from the on-chain value. Individual nodes monitor one or more data providers for each feed.
  * Heartbeat Threshold: A new aggregation round starts after a specified amount of time from the last update.

contract has the following components:

  * The `import` line imports an interface named `AggregatorV3Interface`. Interfaces define functions without their implementation, which leaves inheriting contracts to define the actual implementation themselves. In this case, `AggregatorV3Interface` defines that all v3 Aggregators have the function `latestRoundData`. You can [see the complete code](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/chainlink/blob/develop/contracts/src/v0.8/interfaces/AggregatorV3Interface.sol) for the `AggregatorV3Interface` on GitHub.

  * The `constructor() {}` initializes an interface object named `priceFeed` that uses `AggregatorV3Interface` and connects specifically to a proxy aggregator contract that is already deployed at `0x1b44F3514812d835EB1BDB0acB33d3fA3351Ee43`. The interface allows your contract to run functions on that deployed aggregator contract.

  * The `getLatestPrice()` function calls your `priceFeed` object and runs the `latestRoundData()` function. When you deploy the contract, it initializes the `priceFeed` object to point to the aggregator at `0x1b44F3514812d835EB1BDB0acB33d3fA3351Ee43`, which is the proxy address for the Sepolia BTC / USD data feed. Your contract connects to that address and executes the function. The aggregator connects with several oracle nodes and aggregates the pricing data from those nodes. The response from the aggregator includes several variables, but `getLatestPrice()` returns only the `price` variable.

## AccessControlledOffchainAggregator

This is the contract for the aggregator. You can call functions on the
aggregator directly, but it is a best practice to use the
AggregatorV3Interface to run functions on the proxy instead so that changes to
the aggregator do not affect your application. Read the aggregator contract
only if you need functions that are not available in the proxy.

The aggregator contract has several variables and functions that might be
useful for your application. Although aggregator contracts are similar for
each data feed, some aggregators have different variables. Use the
`typeAndVersion()` function on the aggregator to identify what type of
aggregator it is and what version it is running.

Always check the contract source code and configuration to understand how
specific data feeds operate. For example, the [aggregator contract for BTC/USD
on
Arbitrum](https://arbiscan.io/address/0x942d00008d658dbb40745bbec89a93c253f9b882#code)
is different from the aggregators on other networks.

For examples of the contracts that are typically used in aggregator
deployments, see the [libocr
repository](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/libocr/blob/master/contract/)
on GitHub.

It is possible that the HTTPGet adapter is used to make HTTP GET requests and retrieve data from external APIs, but more information is needed to confirm this.","is a RunLog. This means
that the spec can only be started when a specific event log is emitted from a
specified address. The specified address will be the address of the oracle
contract on Ropsten, which manages requests from contracts and responses from
Chainlink nodes.

The five tasks (referred to as [core adapters](/chainlink-nodes/oracle-jobs/v1/adapters)) in the example above follow a common pattern for requesting
data from the Chainlink network, and returning a single result. Each task
takes three fields: `type`, `confirmations`, and `params`. The `type` is the
adapter or [bridge](/resources/glossary/#bridge) name and is required.
`confirmations` is optional, and will default to 0. `params` is also optional,
and will default to an empty object if not specified. See the [core
adapters](/chainlink-nodes/oracle-jobs/v1/adapters) page for a complete list
of `params` for each adapter.

  1. The **HTTPGet** adapter uses the value in the `get` field to perform a standard HTTP GET request at the value specified. The body of that result is passed on to the next task, JSONParse.
  2. The **JSONParse** adapter takes a dot-delimited string or an array of strings, and will walk the given path to store the value at the end. In this case, there is only one field to save, ""last"". JSONParse will then pass the value stored in the ""last"" field to the Multiply adapter.
  3. The **Multiply** adapter will, as its name describes, multiply the given value by the value of the `times` field, in this case, 100.
  4. The multiplied value will be passed to the **EthUint256** adapter, which will format it specifically for the `uint256` data type on Ethereum. Notice there are no parameters supplied to the EthUint256 adapter, as it

and `times` parameters. These are read by the Tasks in the job to perform correctly. `get` is used by [HTTP](/chainlink-nodes/oracle-jobs/all-tasks/#http-task), `path` is used by [JSON Parse](/chainlink-nodes/oracle-jobs/all-tasks/#json-parse-task) and `times` is used by [Multiply](/chainlink-nodes/oracle-jobs/all-tasks/#multiply-task).
  3. `fulfill` function: This is where the result is sent upon the Oracle Job's completion.

**Note:** The calling contract should own enough LINK to pay the fee, which by
default is 0.1 LINK. You can use [this tutorial](/resources/fund-your-contract) to learn how to fund your contract.

This is an example of a basic HTTP GET request. However, it requires defining
the API URL directly in the smart contract. This can, in fact, be extracted
and configured on the Job level inside the Oracle node. You can follow the
_APIConsumer_ tutorial [here](/any-api/get-request/examples/single-word-response).

### External adapters

If all the parameters are defined within the Oracle job, the only things a
smart contract needs to define to consume are:

  * JobId
  * Oracle address
  * LINK fee
  * Fulfillment function

This will make your smart contract much more succinct. The `requestVolumeData`
function from the code example above would look more like this:


    function requestVolumeData() public returns (bytes32 requestId) {
        Chainlink.Request memory req = buildChainlinkRequest(jobId, address(this), this.fulfill.selector);
    
        // Extra parameters don't need to be defined here because they are already defined in the job
    
        return sendChainlinkRequest(req, fee);

Ethereum Chainlink HTTP Get not pinging my HTTP endpoint
URL: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/70557627/ethereum-chainlink-http-get-not-pinging-my-http-endpoint

Question Body:


I am attempting to have my Ethereum smart contract connect to an external HTTP
endpoint using Chainlink. Following along with Chainlink's documentation
(<https://docs.chain.link/docs/advanced-tutorial/>) I deployed this contract
onto the Rinkeby testnet.

input in the data field of the transaction.
  * `dataPrefix`: **(optional)** data which will be prepended before the adapter's input, but after the `functionSelector` in the transaction's data field.
  * `value`: **(optional)** data to send to the function, will append after the `dataPrefix` payload if it's included. Will automatically come from the previous task.

## EthUint256

The core adapter formats its input into an integer and then converts it into
Solidity's `uint256` format.

#### Parameters

_None taken._

## HttpGet

The core adapter will report the body of a successful `GET` request to the
specified `get`, or return an error if the response status code is greater
than or equal to 400.

#### Parameters

  * `get`: takes a string containing the URL to make a `GET` request to.
  * `queryParams`: takes a string or array of strings for the URL's query parameters.
  * `extPath`: takes a slash-delimited string or array of strings to be appended to the job's URL.
  * `headers`: takes a object containing keys as strings and values as arrays of strings.

Headers

Currently not available on-chain. Available for job specs only.

#### Solidity Example


    req.add(""get"", ""http://example.com"");
    req.add(""queryParams"", ""firstKey=firstVal&secondKey=secondVal"");
    req.add(""extPath"", ""price/BTC/USD"");

#### Job Specification Example

Should I be able to do something like this? Is there a better way to go about
this? Should I edit the adapter instead?

    


:::NEXT DOC:::

IPs are disallowed by default and attempting to connect will result
in an error.

If you really must access one of these IPs, you can use the
`HTTPGetWithUnrestrictedNetworkAccess` adapter instead.

## HttpPost

The core adapter will report the body of a successful `POST` request to the
specified `post`, or return an error if the response status code is greater
than or equal to 400.

#### Parameters

  * `post`: takes a string containing the URL to make a `POST` request to.
  * `headers`: takes a object containing keys as strings and values as arrays of strings.
  * `queryParams`: takes a string or array of strings for the URL's query parameters.
  * `extPath`: takes a slash-delimited string or array of strings to be appended to the job's URL.
  * `body`: the JSON body (as a string) that will be used as the data in the request.

The modifier that sets the authorized consumer is basically the following:

## API Reference

The operator contract inherits
[AuthorizedReceiver](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/chainlink/blob/develop/contracts/src/v0.7/AuthorizedReceiver.sol)
and
[ConfirmedOwnerWithProposal](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/chainlink/edit/develop/contracts/src/v0.7/ConfirmedOwnerWithProposal.sol).

Legacy

Use `operatorRequest` function instead.


    function oracleRequest(address sender, uint256 payment, bytes32 specId, address callbackAddress, bytes4 callbackFunctionId, uint256 nonce, uint256 dataVersion, bytes data) external

Creates the Chainlink request. This is backwards compatible API with
[Oracle.sol
contracts](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/chainlink/blob/develop/contracts/src/v0.4/Oracle.sol),
but the behavior changes because `callbackAddress` is assumed to be the same
as the request sender.

When the a randomness request is sent from VRFConsumer contract, a new
requestId is generated:

    
    
            requestId = COORDINATOR.requestRandomWords(
                keyHash,
                s_subscriptionId,
                requestConfirmations,
                callbackGasLimit,
                numWords
            );
    

The contract has a struct `RequestStatus` containing them and stores the
struct in a mapping `s_requests`.

After the oracle returns the random values to your contract, the mapping
`s_requests` is supposed to be updated, and the `RequestStatus` of a specific
request can be found by a specific `requestId`.

require statement in the fulfillment function is used to check if the
requestId is indeed sent from the vrfConsumer contract.

items:

  * The oracle address.
  * The job ID, so the oracle knows which tasks to perform.
  * The callback function, which the oracle sends the response to.

To learn about how to find oracles to suit your needs, see [Find Existing
Jobs](/any-api/find-oracle).

Oracle contracts are responsible for handling on-chain requests made through
the LINK token, by implementing `onTokenTransfer` as a
[`LinkTokenReceiver`](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/chainlink/blob/master/contracts/src/v0.6/LinkTokenReceiver.sol).
Upon execution of this function, the oracle contract **emits an`OracleRequest`
event** containing information about the request. This event is crucial, as it
is monitored by the off-chain oracle node which acts upon it.

#### Fulfillment

For fulfillment, the oracle contract has a `fulfillOracleRequest` function
which is used by the node to fulfill a request once it has the result of the
job. This function returns the result to the `ChainlinkClient` using the
callback function defined in the original request.

### Off-Chain Oracle Node

The off-chain oracle node is responsible for listening for events emitted by
its corresponding on-chain smart contract. Once it detects an `OracleRequest`
event, it uses the data emitted to perform a job.

The most common job type for a Node is to make a GET request to an API,
retrieve some data from it, parse the response, convert the result into
blockchain compatible data, then submit it in a transaction back to the oracle
contract, using the `fulfillOracleRequest` function.

In Chainlink oracle workflow, consumers are basically supposed to send a
request to the off-chain oracle node so that the oracle node can fetch data
from the API specified by consumers. In the workflow, request sent by user
must be caught by off-chain oracle node.

What you are doing here is to send your request to smart contract `oracle` and
the `oracle` save your request into event log `oracleRequest` so that it could
be caught by off-chain oracle.

Your problem here is as suggested by modifier `permittedFunctionForLINK`, the
function selector is not `oracleRequest` so that off-chain oracle cannot
recognize the request.

I am guessing you are currently using the `oracle.sol` and
`ChainlinkClient.sol` in version v0.6. In version v0.6, AFAIK, ChainlinkClient
doesn't not help users to add function selector `oracleRequest` in the users'
Chainlink request, which means you will get the error if you doesn't manually
add the function selector in your request. In v0.7, ChainlinkClient helps you
add the selector in the request. Just check the function
`sendChainlinkRequestTo` in [ChainlinkClient
v0.6](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/chainlink/blob/develop/contracts/src/v0.6/ChainlinkClient.sol)
and [ChainlinkClient
v0.7](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/chainlink/blob/develop/contracts/src/v0.7/ChainlinkClient.sol)
by yourself.

Solutions:

  1. Use the v0.7 ChainlinkClient and [operator.sol](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/chainlink/blob/develop/contracts/src/v0.7/Operator.sol)(smart contract

            [requestId, '123', '456', '789', 'text', 'moreText'])
    
    
        const encodeRequestId = web3.eth.abi.encodeParameters(
            ['bytes32'],

        await mockOracle.connect(mockNode).fulfillOracleRequest2(requestIdfirst, payment, callbackAddr, callbackFunctionId, cancelExpiration, encodeMwr)

To improve on this you could then look to add an API http GET call into your
test script for getting the rest of the callback data for fulfillOracleRequest
or fulfillOracleRequest2 function.

in your program. The source code for this program is available in the

You can add data feeds to an existing project or use the Solana Starter Kit.

## Adding Data Feeds On-Chain In An Existing Project

You can read Chainlink Data Feed data on-chain in your existing project using
the [Chainlink Solana Crate](https://crates.io/crates/chainlink_solana).

Reading feed data

Although you can directly query the data feed accounts, you should not rely on
the memory layout always being the same as it currently is. Based on this, the
recommendation is to always use the consumer library queries below.

Import the Chainlink Solana Crate into your project and use the code sample to
make function calls.

  1. Add the Chainlink Solana Crate as an entry in your `Cargo.toml` file dependencies section, as shown in the [starter kit Cargo.toml example](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/solana-starter-kit/blob/main/programs/chainlink_solana_demo/Cargo.toml).
    
        [dependencies]
    chainlink_solana = ""1.0.0""

  2. Use the following code sample to query price data. Each function call to the Chainlink Solana library takes two parameters:

    * The [feed account](/data-feeds/price-feeds/addresses?network=solana) that you want to query.
    * The Chainlink Data Feeds OCR2 Program for the network. This is a static value that never changes.

The code sample has the following components:

    * `latest_round_data`: Returns the latest

  * [Solana CLI](https://docs.solana.com/cli): The Solana command line interface
  * [Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git): Used to clone the example code repository

When developing applications to use Chainlink products on Solana, always use a
[Mainnet release](https://github.com/solana-labs/solana/releases) version of
the Solana CLI that is equal to or greater than the version currently running
on your target cluster. Use `solana --version` and `solana cluster-version` to
check CLI and cluster versions:


    solana --version
    solana-cli 1.9.28 (src:b576e9cc; feat:320703611)
    
    solana cluster-version --url devnet
    1.9.25
    
    solana cluster-version --url mainnet-beta
    1.9.28

The examples in this documentation use Solana programs in
[Rust](https://docs.solana.com/developing/on-chain-programs/developing-rust),
but you can also write Solana programs in
[C](https://docs.solana.com/developing/on-chain-programs/developing-c). To

# Data Feeds on Solana

  * Overview
  * Chainlink products and Solana clusters
  * Languages, tools, and frameworks
  * Solana Wallets

Chainlink provides data feeds on the [Solana](https://solana.com/) network.
Chainlink data feeds on Solana employ [Off-Chain Reporting
(OCR)](/architecture-overview/off-chain-reporting?parent=dataFeeds) to
aggregate data from data providers who pull from both centralized and
decentralized exchanges. Chainlink뗩 Solana deployment has no dependencies on
external blockchain networks such as Ethereum. In Solana, storage and smart
contract logic are separate. Programs store all the logic similar to an EVM
(Ethereum) smart contract. The accounts store all the data. Compared to
Solidity, the combination of an account and a program is equivalent to a smart
contract on an EVM chain. State and logic are separate in Solana.

Solana programs are stateless, so you don't always need to deploy your program
to the network to test it. You can deploy and test your programs on a [Solana
Test Validator](https://docs.solana.com/developing/test-validator). However,
to use Chainlink products on Solana, you must deploy your contract on-chain to
one of the supported Solana clusters.

## Using the Solana Starter Kit

This guide demonstrates the following tasks:

  * Write and deploy programs to the [Solana Devnet](https://solscan.io/?cluster=devnet) cluster using Anchor.
  * Retrieve price data data using the [Solana Web3 JavaScript API](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@solana/web3.js) with Node.js.

This example shows a full end to end example of using Chainlink Price Feeds on
Solana. It includes an on-chain program written in rust, as well as an off-
chain client written in JavaScript. The client passes in an account to the
program, the program then looks up the latest price of the specified price
feed account, and then stores the result in the passed in account. The off-
chain client then reads the value stored in the account.

### Install the required tools

Before you begin, set up your environment for development on Solana:

  1. Install [Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git) if it is not already configured on your system.

  2. Install [Node.js 14 or higher](https://nodejs.org/en/download/). Run `node --version` to verify which version you have installed:
    
        node --version

  3. Install [Yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/) to simplify package management and run code samples.

  4. Install a C compiler such as the one included in [GCC](https://gcc.gnu.org/install/). Some of the dependencies require a C compiler.

  5. Install [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install):

manipulation. Assets with low liquidity can be volatile, which might
negatively impact your application and its users. Malicious actors might try
to exploit volatility to take advantage of the logic in a smart contract and

Some data feeds obtain their pricing data from individual exchanges rather
than from aggregated price tracking services that gather their data from
multiple exchanges. These are marked as such in the docs page for that feed.
Assess the liquidity and reliability of that specific exchange.

_Liquidity migrations_ occur when a project moves its tokens from one
liquidity provider (such as a DEX, a CEX, or a new DeFi application) to
another. When liquidity migrations occur, it can result in low liquidity in
the original pool, making the asset susceptible to market manipulation. If
your project is considering a liquidity migration, you should coordinate with
relevant stakeholders, including liquidity providers, exchanges, oracle node
operators, and users, to ensure prices are accurately reported throughout the
migration.

Feeds for assets with low market liquidity where data providers exhibit an
abnormal price spread may, on occasion, see a price oscillate between two or
more price points within regular intervals. To mitigate risk associated with
such price oscillation, users must regularly monitor & assess the quality of
an asset뗩 liquidity. Similarly, assets with low market liquidity may
experience abnormal or volatile price movements due to erroneous trades.

Design and test your contracts to handle price spikes and implement risk
management measures to protect your assets. For example, create mock tests
that return various oracle responses.

one source exists off-chain for a specific type of data. Evaluate data
providers to make sure

project. Users are responsible for thoroughly vetting and validating such
deployments and determining their suitability.

## Evaluating Data Sources and Risks

If your smart contracts use data feeds, assess those data feeds for the
following characteristics:

  * Liquidity and its Distribution
  * Single Source Data Providers
  * Crypto and Blockchain Actions
  * Market Failures Resulting from Extreme Events
  * Periods of High Network Congestion
  * Unknown and Known Users
  * Fast Gas Reliability

### Liquidity and its Distribution

If your smart contract relies on pricing data for a specific asset, make sure
that the asset has sufficient liquidity in the market to avoid price
manipulation. Assets with low liquidity can be volatile, which might
negatively impact your application and its users. Malicious actors might try
to exploit volatility to take advantage of the logic in a smart contract and

### Single Source Data Providers

Some data providers use a single data source, which might be necessary if only
one source exists off-chain for a specific type of data. Evaluate data
providers to make sure they provide high-quality data that your smart
contracts can rely on. Any error or omission in the provider's data might
negatively impact your application and its users.

### Crypto and Blockchain Actions

Price data quality is subject to crypto actions by the crypto and blockchain
project teams. Crypto actions are similar to [corporate
actions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corporate_action) but are specific to
cryptocurrency and blockchain projects, such as token renaming, token swaps,
redenominations, splits, network upgrades, and other migrations that teams who
govern the blockchain or token might undertake

Sustaining data quality is dependent on data sources implementing the
necessary adjustments related to such actions. For example, when a project
upgrades to a new version of their token, this results in a _token migration_.
When token migrations occur, they require building a new price feed to ensure
that the token price is accurately reported. Similarly, actions by blockchain
project teams, such as forks or upgrades to the network, may require new Price
Feeds to ensure continuity and data quality. When considering a token
migration, fork, network upgrade, or

migration, fork, network upgrade, or other crypto action, projects should
proactively reach out to relevant stakeholders to ensure the asset price is
accurately reported throughout the process.

### Market Failures Resulting from Extreme Events

Users are strongly advised to set up monitoring and alerts in the event of
unexpected market failures. Black swan events, hacks, coordinated attacks, or
extreme market conditions may trigger unanticipated outcomes such as liquidity
pools becoming unbalanced, unexpected re-weighting of indices, abnormal
behavior by centralized or decentralized exchanges, or the de-pegging of
synthetic assets, stablecoins, and currencies from their intended exchange
rates.

Circuit breakers can be created using [Chainlink Automation](/chainlink-automation/introduction). Circuit breakers are safety measures that monitor
data feeds for unexpected scenarios such as stale prices, drastic price
changes, or prices approaching a predetermined min/max threshold. If an
unexpected scenario occurs, the circuit breaker can send an on-chain
transaction to pause or halt contract functionality.

### Periods of High Network Congestion

Data Feed performance relies on the chains they are deployed on.

:::NEXT DOC:::

high levels of
data quality and reliability over latency.

To mitigate the risk associated with front running, users building highly
latency-dependent applications should assess whether the configuration of data
feeds meets their needed specifications for speed and frequency.

### Fast Gas Reliability

The [Fast Gas Data Feed](https://data.chain.link/ethereum/mainnet/gas/fast-gas-gwei) provides a simple way to determine the price of gas so you can
estimate how much gas you need to make a transaction execute quickly. Fast gas
prices can be manipulated, so you should design your applications to detect
gas price volatility or malicious activity that might affect the costs of your
transactions.

developing the
ecosystem, so we continue to develop our software and tooling for anyone to
use. Users have a wide variety of options for choosing how to deliver data on-
chain. They can deploy Chainlink nodes themselves or via the extensive network
of node operators that offer services and access one of the community-managed
oracle networks that support the supply of various types of data on-chain.
Chainlink Labs does not take responsibility for the use of Chainlink node
software.

It is always recommended that you conduct a thorough analysis of your
requirements and carry out appropriate due diligence on any partners you wish
to use with your project.

**The Chainlink Labs team does not monitor community deployments** and users
should use best practices in observability, monitoring, and risk mitigation as
appropriate for your application's stage of development and use case.

As your usage of data feeds evolves and requirements for higher availability
and greater security increases, such as securing substantive value, the
reliability properties of your data feed will become crucial. [Contact

and trusted answer.

Each oracle operator is rewarded for publishing data. On mainnet, [sponsors
are paying the LINK
associated](https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/questions/90728/what-is-the-
cost-of-using-a-chainlink-oracle/90752#90752) to keep those feeds live,
decentralized, and secure, so they are not free. This allows the network to be
a shared resource where everyone chips in a tiny bit and makes them even
cheaper than running even your own centralized feed.

That being said, the price feeds are currently a simple `view` function, and
anyone can technically use them as access controls are on the roadmap to be
built at some point. It뗩 not really economical or fair for those backers who
are paying to support them for everyone else. Until access controls are built,
please reach out if you are using them on mainnet and learn how you can
contribute to keep them reliable honest, and secure.

**With API calls** , Chainlink enables your contracts to access any external
data source, through their decentralized oracle network. Making a HTTP GET
request will fail unless your deployed contract has enough LINK to pay for it,
therefore one needs to fund that smart contract.

If your contract is calling a public API endpoint, an Oracle job may already
exist for it. To check available jobs and GET request prices, visit

give up control of their crypto assets, so trust is involved as they rely on the bridge operator's reputation.
  * Trustless (non-custodial) bridges leverage smart contracts to store and release funds on either side of the bridge. These bridges are trust-minimized because they don't make new trust assumptions beyond the underlying blockchains.

Trustlessness in bridges does not exist in an absolute form (trusted vs.
trustless). As explained in the blockchain-interoperability
[blog](https://blog.chain.link/blockchain-interoperability/), there are four
general interoperability solutions for validating the state of a source
blockchain and relaying the subsequent transaction to the destination
blockchain:

#### Web2 Verification

Web2 verification is when someone uses a web2 service to execute a cross-chain
transaction. The most common example in practice is when users leverage
centralized exchanges to swap or bridge their own tokens. The user simply
deposits their assets into an address on the source chain that's under the
control of the exchange and then withdraws the same tokens or different tokens
(via a swap on the exchange) to an address on a destination chain controlled
by the user.

Web2 verification can be fairly convenient for personal transactions and
requires less technical expertise. However, it is limited only to swapping and
bridging tokens which requires trust in a centralized custodian.

#### External verification

External verification is where a group of validator nodes are responsible for
verifying transactions. These validators do not belong to either of the two
blockchains validator sets and they also have their trust assumptions
irrespective of the underlying blockchains.

External verification typically requires an honest majority assumption, where
a majority of the external validator nodes must behave honestly for the
integrity of the cross-chain interaction to be upheld. However, additional
techniques can be used to increase trust-minimization, such as:



:::NEXT DOC:::

basis considering the liquidity,
depth, and trading volatility of the underlying asset compared to its
derivative. In addition, users must consider the security mechanism that is
designed to keep the wrapped or bridged asset coupled to its underlying asset.
Review these parameters regularly as asset dynamics continuously evolve.

### Extreme Events Causing Price Deviations in Wrapped or Bridged Assets

Chainlink Price Feeds are designed to provide the market-wide price of various
assets, as determined by a volume-weighted average across a wide range of
exchanges. On blockchain networks where assets are wrapped and/or bridged from
another environment using a cross-chain token bridge, Chainlink Price Feeds
built for the underlying asset will continue to report the market-wide price
of the underlying asset as opposed to the price of the wrapped/bridged asset.
This methodology reduces risks around market manipulation because
wrapped/bridged tokens are often less liquid than the underlying asset.

However, users should be aware that certain extreme events may result in price
deviations between the wrapped/bridged asset and its underlying counterpart.
For example, the exploitation or hack of a cross-chain token bridge may cause
a collapse in demand for a particular wrapped asset. As such, users should
construct their applications with safeguards, such as circuit breakers to
proactively pause functionality to mitigate risk during such scenarios.
Circuit breakers can be created using Chainlink Automation to monitor data
feeds for unexpected scenarios.

An additional mechanism for securing a protocol utilizing wrapped assets is by
incorporating [Chainlink Proof of Reserve](https://chain.link/proof-of-reserve). Chainlink Proof of Reserve enables the real-time reserve monitoring
of off-chain and cross-chain assets, including those that have been
wrapped/bridged. By comparing the wrapped token뗩 supply against a

financial risks

To transfer tokens cross-chain, many bridges lock tokens on the source chain
and mint derivative or wrapped tokens on the destination chain representing
the locked tokens. A hack of the locked tokens or an infinite mint attack on
the wrapped tokens can make all wrapped tokens worthless and expose entire
blockchains to risk.

### Early stage

Given that bridges are relatively new, there are many unanswered questions
related to how bridges will perform in different market conditions.

### Trust-minimization (Counterparty risk)

To overcome cross-chain interoperability challenges, some bridges use off-
chain actors or validators. These actors introduce new trust assumptions in
addition to the underlying blockchain trust assumptions. These bridges act as
a custodian and are, therefore, trust-based. In contrast, some bridge designs
rely on underlying blockchains' validators and, therefore, do not add any
trust assumptions. To summarize:

  * Trusted (custodial) bridges require a third party to validate movements over the bridge. Users are required to give up control of their crypto assets, so trust is involved as they rely on the bridge operator's reputation.
  * Trustless (non-custodial) bridges leverage smart contracts to store and release funds on either side of the bridge. These bridges are trust-minimized because they don't make new trust assumptions beyond the underlying blockchains.

Trustlessness in bridges does not exist in an absolute form (trusted vs.
trustless). As explained in the blockchain-interoperability
[blog](https://blog.chain.link/blockchain-interoperability/), there are four
general interoperability solutions for validating the state of a source
blockchain and relaying the subsequent transaction to the destination
blockchain:

# Subscription Manager Contract

Now that we learned more about the theoretical background, let뗩 get practical. We want to create and manage a subscription contract. We will use the example contract that you can find here on [Remix](https://remix.ethereum.org/#url=https://docs.chain.link/samples/VRF/VRFv2SubscriptionManager.sol&optimize=false&runs=200&evmVersion=null&version=soljson-v0.8.7+commit.e28d00a7.js). It shows an example implementation of a VRF v2 Subscription manager for the Goerli network. But you can also adjust it to work with other networks by changing the code's hardcoded addresses. You can find a complete list of available networks [here](https://docs.chain.link/docs/vrf-contracts/#configurations).

Hint: This course assumes you are already familiar with the Architecture of Chainlink VRF from [VRFv2 Introduction Chapter 4](https://www.chainlink.education/vrfIntroduction/chapter-4).

Generally, consumer contracts must implement the requestRandomWords() function providing coordinator parameters and subscription ID. This function is used to create random values. A second function, fulfillRandomWords(), must be implemented to receive the random values. Learn about how to implement the basics of such a contract in [chapters 6-12](https://www.chainlink.education/vrfIntroduction/chapter-6) from the introduction course.

We want to focus on the mentioned functions here and show how to manage subscriptions in this contract. So let뗩 start by creating a new subscription:

Subscription Manager

Read the [Subcription Manager UI](/vrf/v2/subscription/ui/) page to learn how
to use all the features of the VRF v2 user interface. To learn how to
troubleshoot your VRF requests, read the
[pending](/vrf/v2/subscription/ui/#pending) and [failed
requests](/vrf/v2/subscription/ui/#failed-requests) sections.

Go to [vrf.chain.link](https://vrf.chain.link) to open the Subscription
Manager.

Subscriptions have the following core concepts:

  * **Subscription id:** 64-bit unsigned integer representing the unique identifier of the subscription.
  * **Subscription accounts:** An account that holds LINK tokens and makes them available to fund requests to Chainlink VRF v2 coordinators.
  * **Subscription owner:** The wallet address that creates and manages a subscription account. Any account can add LINK to the subscription balance, but only the owner can add approved consuming contracts or withdraw funds.
  * **Consumers:** Consuming contracts that are approved to use funding from your subscription account.
  * **Subscription balance:** The amount of LINK maintained on your subscription account. Requests from consuming contracts will continue to be funded until the balance runs out, so be sure to maintain sufficient funds in your subscription balance to pay for the requests and keep your applications running.

For Chainlink VRF v2 to fulfill your requests, you must maintain a sufficient
amount of LINK in your subscription balance. Gas cost calculation includes the
following variables:

  * **Gas price:** The current gas price, which fluctuates depending on network conditions.

  * **Callback gas:** The amount of gas used for the callback request that returns your requested random values.

  * **Verification gas:** The amount of gas used to verify randomness on-chain.

Security Considerations

Be sure to review your contracts with the [security
considerations](/vrf/v2/security/) in mind.

How you manage the subscription depends on your randomness needs. You can
configure your subscriptions using the [Subscription
Manager](/vrf/v2/subscription/ui), but these examples demonstrate how to
create your subscription and add your consumer contracts programmatically. For
these examples, the contract owns and manages the subscription. Any wallet can
provide funding to those subscriptions.

You can view and monitor your subscriptions in the [Subscription
Manager](/vrf/v2/subscription/ui) even if you create them programmatically. Go
to [vrf.chain.link](https://vrf.chain.link) to open the Subscription Manager.

## Modifying subscriptions and configurations

Subscription configurations do not have to be static. You can change your
subscription configuration dynamically by calling the following functions
using the
[VRFCoordinatorV2Interface](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/chainlink/blob/develop/contracts/src/v0.8/interfaces/VRFCoordinatorV2Interface.sol):

## Subscriptions

VRF v2 requests receive funding from subscription accounts. The [Subscription
Manager](/vrf/v2/subscription/ui) lets you create an account and pre-pay for
VRF v2, so you don't provide funding each time your application requests
randomness. This reduces the total gas cost to use VRF v2. It also provides a
simple way to fund your use of Chainlink products from a single location, so
you don't have to manage multiple wallets across several different systems and
applications.

## Modifying subscriptions and configurations

Subscription configurations do not have to be static. You can change your
subscription configuration dynamically by calling the following functions
using the
[VRFCoordinatorV2Interface](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/chainlink/blob/develop/contracts/src/v0.8/interfaces/VRFCoordinatorV2Interface.sol):

  * Change the list of approved subscription consumers with:

    * `removeConsumer(uint64 subId, address consumer)`.
  * Transfer the subscription ownership with: 
    * `requestSubscriptionOwnerTransfer(uint64 subId, address newOwner)`.
    * `acceptSubscriptionOwnerTransfer(uint64 subId)`.
  * View the subscription with `getSubscription(uint64 subId)`.
  * Cancel the subscription with `cancelSubscription(uint64 subId)`.

To send LINK to the subscription balance, use the LINK token interface with
`LINKTOKEN.transferAndCall(address(COORDINATOR), amount, abi.encode(subId))`.
Any wallet can fund a subscription.

See the example in the Subscription manager contract section to learn how to
create a contract that can change your subscription configuration.

## Subscription manager contract

In this example, the contract operates as a subscription owner and can run
functions to add consuming contracts to the subscription. The consuming
contracts must include the `requestRandomWords()` function with the correct
coordinator parameters and the correct subscription ID to request random
values and use the subscription balance. The consuming contracts must also
include the `fulfillRandomWords()` function to receive the random values.

your VRF requests.



Subscription components:

  * **Status** : Indicates if the subscription is still active or not.
  * **ID** : The unique subscription identifier. Approved consuming contracts use LINK from this subscription to pay for each randomness request.
  * **Admin** : The account address that owns this subscription ID.
  * **Consumers** : The number of consuming contracts that are approved to make VRF requests using this subscription.
  * **Fulfillment** : The number of successful randomness requests that are already completed.
  * **Balance** : The amount of LINK remaining to be used for requests that use this subscription.

page to learn more.

  * **Multiple Random Outputs in a Single Request:** The [VRF Coordinator contracts](/vrf/v2/subscription/supported-networks) in VRF v2 allow you to request multiple random numbers (multi-word) in a single on-chain transaction, which reduces gas costs. The fulfillment is also a single transaction, which reduces the latency of responses.

  * **Unified Billing - Delegate Subscription Balance to Multiple Addresses:** Chainlink VRF v2 allows up to 100 smart contract addresses to fund their requests for verifiable randomness from a single LINK subscription balance, which is managed by the subscription owner.

Subscription owners and consumers do not have to be separate. This contract
not only allows adding consumers with `addConsumer(address consumerAddress)`
but can also act as a consumer by running its own `requestRandomWords()`
function. This example contract includes a `createNewSubscription()` function
in the `constructor()` that creates the subscription and adds itself as a
consumer automatically when you deploy it.

## Two methods to request randomness

Chainlink VRF v2 offers two methods for requesting randomness:

  * [Subscription](/vrf/v2/subscription): Create a subscription account and fund its balance with LINK tokens. Users can then connect multiple consuming contracts to the subscription account. When the consuming contracts request randomness, the transaction costs are calculated after the randomness requests are fulfilled and the subscription balance is deducted accordingly. This method allows you to fund requests for multiple consumer contracts from a single subscription.
  * [Direct funding](/vrf/v2/direct-funding): Consuming contracts directly pay with LINK when they request random values. You must directly fund your consumer contracts and ensure that there are enough LINK tokens to pay for randomness requests.

## Choosing the correct method

Depending on your use case, one method might be more suitable than another.
Consider the following characteristics when you choose a method:

  * Two methods to request randomness
  * Choosing the correct method
  * Supported networks

Get Started

Access verified randomness at [vrf.chain.link](https://vrf.chain.link).

**Chainlink VRF (Verifiable Random Function)** is a provably fair and
verifiable random number generator (RNG) that enables smart contracts to
access random values without compromising security or usability. For each
request, Chainlink VRF generates one or more random values and cryptographic
proof of how those values were determined. The proof is published and verified
on-chain before any consuming applications can use it. This process ensures
that results cannot be tampered with or manipulated by any single entity
including oracle operators, miners, users, or smart contract developers.

Security Considerations

Be sure to review your contracts with the [security
considerations](/vrf/v2/security/) in mind.

Use Chainlink VRF to build reliable smart contracts for any applications that
rely on unpredictable outcomes:

  * Building blockchain games and NFTs.
  * Random assignment of duties and resources. For example, randomly assigning judges to cases.
  * Choosing a representative sample for consensus mechanisms.

how to consume random numbers with Chainlink VRF in smart
contracts.

## How is randomness generated on blockchains? What is Chainlink VRF?

Randomness is very difficult to generate on blockchains. This is because every
node on the blockchain must come to the same conclusion and form a consensus.
Even though random numbers are versatile and useful in a variety of blockchain
applications, they cannot be generated natively in smart contracts. The
solution to this issue is [**Chainlink VRF**](/vrf/v2/introduction), also
known as Chainlink Verifiable Random Function.

## What is the Request and Receive cycle?

The [previous guide](/getting-started/consuming-data-feeds) explained how to
consume Chainlink Data Feeds, which consist of reference data posted on-chain
by oracles. This data is stored in a contract and can be referenced by
consumers until the oracle updates the data again.

Randomness, on the other hand, cannot be reference data. If the result of
randomness is stored on-chain, any actor could retrieve the value and predict
the outcome. Instead, randomness must be requested from an oracle, which
generates a number and a cryptographic proof. Then, the oracle returns that
result to the contract that requested it. This sequence is known as the
**[Request and Receive cycle](/architecture-overview/architecture-request-model)**.

## What is the payment process for generating a random number?

VRF requests receive funding from subscription accounts. The [Subscription
Manager](https://vrf.chain.link) lets you create an account and pre-pay for
VRF requests, so that funding of all your application requests are managed in
a single location. To learn more about VRF requests funding, see

For each request, Chainlink VRF generates one or more random values and
cryptographic proof of how those values were determined. It is unlikely that a
Chainlink VRF would return the same randomness in one request.

## Generate Random Numbers in your Smart Contracts

Chainlink VRF (Verifiable Random Function) is a provably-fair and verifiable
source of randomness designed for smart contracts. Smart contract developers
can use Chainlink VRF as a tamper-proof random number generator (RNG) to build
reliable smart contracts for any applications which rely on unpredictable
outcomes:

  * Blockchain games and NFTs
  * Random assignment of duties and resources (e.g. randomly assigning judges to cases)
  * Choosing a representative sample for consensus mechanisms

Number](/vrf/v1/examples/get-a-random-number).

## On-chain Verification of Randomness

Chainlink VRF enables smart contracts to access randomness without
compromising on security or usability. With every new request for randomness,
Chainlink VRF generates a random number and cryptographic proof of how that
number was determined. The proof is published and verified on-chain before it
can be used by any consuming applications. This process ensures that the
results cannot be tampered with nor manipulated by anyone, including oracle
operators, miners, users and even smart contract developers.

Chainlink VRF generates a random number and cryptographic proof of how that
number was determined. The proof is published and verified on-chain before it
can be used by any consuming applications. This process ensures that the
results cannot be tampered with nor manipulated by anyone, including oracle
operators, miners, users and even smart contract developers.

# Direct Funding Method

  * Overview
  * VRF direct funding
  * Request and receive data
  * Set up your contract and request
  * How VRF processes your request
  * Limits

You are viewing the VRF v2 guide - Direct funding method.

To learn how to request random numbers with a subscription, see the
[Subscription Method](/vrf/v2/subscription/) guide.

Security Considerations

Be sure to review your contracts with the [security
considerations](/vrf/v2/security/) in mind.

This guide explains how to generate random numbers using the _direct funding_
method. This method doesn't require a subscription and is optimal for one-off
requests for randomness. This method also works best for applications where
your end-users must pay the fees for VRF because the cost of the request is
determined at request time.

## VRF direct funding

Unlike the [subscription method](/vrf/v2/subscription), the direct funding
method does not require you to create subscriptions and pre-fund them.
Instead, you must directly fund consuming contracts with LINK tokens before
they request randomness. Because the consuming contract directly pays the LINK
for the request, the cost is calculated during the request and not during the
callback when the randomness is fulfilled. Learn [how to estimate
costs](/vrf/v2/estimating-costs).

## Request and receive data

Requests to Chainlink VRF v2 follow the request and receive data cycle. This
end-to-end diagram shows each step in the lifecycle of a VRF direct funding
request:

Two types of accounts exist in the Ethereum ecosystem, and both are used in
VRF:

  * EOA (Externally Owned Account): An externally owned account that has a private key and can control a smart contract. Transactions can be initiated only by EOAs.
  * Smart contract: A smart contract that does not have a private key and executes what it has been designed

  * Smart contract: A smart contract that does not have a private key and executes what it has been designed for as a decentralized application.

The Chainlink VRF v2 solution uses both off-chain and on-chain components:

  * [VRF v2 Wrapper (on-chain component)](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/chainlink/blob/develop/contracts/src/v0.8/vrf/VRFV2Wrapper.sol): A wrapper for the VRF Coordinator that provides an interface for consuming contracts.
  * [VRF v2 Coordinator (on-chain component)](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/chainlink/blob/develop/contracts/src/v0.8/vrf/VRFCoordinatorV2.sol): A contract designed to interact with the VRF service. It emits an event when a request for randomness is made, and then verifies the random number and proof of how it was generated by the VRF service.
  * VRF service (off-chain component): Listens for requests by subscribing to the VRF Coordinator event logs and calculates a random number based on the block hash and nonce. The VRF service then sends a transaction to the `VRFCoordinator` including the random number and a proof of how it was"

## Configure your on-chain resources

After you configure your local environment, configure some on-chain resources
to process your requests, receive the responses, and pay for the work done by
the DON.

Deploy an on-chain
[FunctionsConsumer.sol](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/functions-hardhat-starter-kit/blob/main/contracts/FunctionsConsumer.sol) contract, create a
[subscription](/chainlink-functions/resources/subscriptions), and fund the
subscription with LINK to pay for requests after they are fulfilled.

  1. Deploy the consumer contract and record the contract address. For now, you can skip on-chain contract verification with the `--verify false` flag. If you do need to [verify](https://blog.chain.link/how-to-verify-a-smart-contract-on-etherscan) your contract on-chain, sign up for a [free Polygonscan API key](https://polygonscan.com/login) and include the key in your `.env.enc` file by running `npx env-enc set` and set `POLYGONSCAN_API_KEY`.

# Security and Operation Best Practices

  * Overview
  * Restricting Access
  * Failover Capabilities
  * Disaster Recovery
  * Active Monitoring
  * Frequent Updates
  * Jobs and Config
  * Addresses
  * Infrastructure as Code (IaC)

The following information provides a set of security and operation best
practices that node operators need to use at a minimum to enhance the security
and reliability of their infrastructure.

## Restricting Access

To run a Chainlink node, the Operator UI port does not need to be open on the
internet for it to correctly function. Due to this, we strongly recommend
restricting access to all of the services required over the internet.

**Minimum Requirements:**

  * SSH (port 22 or changed from the default) is open, and access to the node is granted via SSH tunnelling. This is done typically by adding `-L 6688:localhost:6688` to your SSH command.
  * Access to the Ethereum client that the Chainlink node uses is restricted to solely the Chainlink node. This includes ports 8545 and 8546, but excludes 30303 for P2P traffic.

**Recommended:**

  * The use of a VPN restricts access to only those who are signed into the VPN in order to access internal resources. For example, this can be achieved by using something like [OpenVPN Access Server](https://openvpn.net/vpn-server/).
  * With the use of the VPN, all traffic between Chainlink nodes and Ethereum clients is routed internally rather than over the internet. For example, all servers are placed in an internal subnet range such as `10.0.0.0/16` and use these IP addresses for communicating.
  * Chainlink nodes have the potential to send arbitrary HTTP GET and POST requests, exposing internal network resources. We recommend deploying with a DMZ which has strong outbound network restrictions.

## Failover Capabilities

to make an HTTP GET request and parse the _json_ response to retrieve the
value of one single attribute.

### Multi-Variable Responses

This [guide](/any-api/get-request/examples/multi-variable-responses) explains
how to make an HTTP GET request and parse the _json_ response to retrieve the
values of multiple attributes.

### Fetch data from an Array

This [guide](/any-api/get-request/examples/array-response) explains how to
make an HTTP GET request that returns a _json_ array and parse it to retrieve
the target element's value.

### Large Responses

This [guide](/any-api/get-request/examples/large-responses) explains how to
make an HTTP Get request that returns a _json_ containing an arbitrary-length
raw byte data and parse it to return the data as _bytes_ data type.

### Make an Existing Job Request

This [guide](/any-api/get-request/examples/existing-job-request) explains how
to call a job that leverages [External adapters](/chainlink-nodes/external-adapters/external-adapters/) and returns the relevant data to the smart
contract. This allows building succinct smart contracts that do not need to
comprehend the URL or the response format of the target API.

The problem is, in the chainlink node, specifically in the `fetch` method it
gives me an error: `error making http request: Post ""http://localhost:8080"":
dial tcp 127.0.0.1:8080: connect: connection refused`

Is it related to the docker container? I don't see why it wouldn't be able to
request resuources from another port in the same machine. Am I missing some
configuration maybe? From what I've read from the docs it's possible to run
the adapter locally. Below, a picture with more information:

If you're External Adapter (EA) is running on `http://localhost:8080` and
you're trying to reach that EA from a Chainlink node running inside Docker,
then you can't use `localhost`, you need to get out of the Docker container
and onto the host running the Docker engine (your Windows or Mac machine).

To do, so define your bridge to use `http://host.docker.internal:8080`.

Further details can be found in the [Docker
Docs](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/windows/networking/).

  * Chainlink nodes have the potential to send arbitrary HTTP GET and POST requests, exposing internal network resources. We recommend deploying with a DMZ which has strong outbound network restrictions.

## Failover Capabilities

To ensure there is very minimal downtime, failover capabilities are required
on both the Chainlink and Ethereum clients so that if any one server fails,
the service is still online.

**Minimum Requirements:**

  * Chainlink nodes are using a PostgreSQL database that are not on the same servers as the Chainlink nodes.
  * At least two Chainlink nodes are running at any one time, with both of them pointing to the same database to ensure failover if one fails.

**Ethereum-specific:**

  * Ethereum client websocket connectivity is fronted by a load balancer, used by the Chainlink nodes. [Here is an example on how to set up a load balancer](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/latest/application/tutorial-target-ecs-containers.html). 
    * If a VPN and internal routing is configured, SSL is not needed but still recommended, as all traffic is purely internal.
    * If both Ethereum and Chainlink nodes are public facing without a VPN, SSL is required to ensure that no communication between both can be intercepted.

increase the chances of an attacker cheating your application. Imagine you implemented a simple coin flip smart contract using VRF v2. In a bet function, you choose heads or tails and then request a random number. If you have selected heads (0) and the result of the VRF service meant that you would win the bet, it could try to withhold this answer and replace it with your second request if it뗩 more advantageous.

So you see, we must consider the unique properties of blockchains here to ensure randomness in our smart contracts. While the numbers are always random, we must also look into how our applications and smart contracts deal with them. In the end, it will be a matter of cost if it's worth attacking your application. You must also be aware of the protocol that you are using.

In general, re-organizations on chains are possible. A miner would take your request and try to create a new random number with a different block and do this until they find a block to their advantage. They cannot control the VRF output but can ""re-roll"" the dice. If they manage to produce a valid blockchain with this new block and the network accepts this block instead, they could effectively attack your application by controlling the random input.
While this is a possible attack, it's costly to attack a network like this, as in the proof of network. You need at least 51% of the network to drive such an attack. Depending on your application requirements, you consider a 20-block confirmation time highly secure. You can lower the block confirmation time depending on the value you are trying to protect. You must calculate an attacker's costs and potential reward to decide your confirmation time.

Chainlink Proof of Reserve Feeds provide the status of the reserves for
several assets. You can read these feeds the same way that you read other Data
Feeds. Specify the [Proof of Reserve Feed Address](/data-feeds/proof-of-reserve/addresses) that you want to read instead of specifying a Price Feed

To find a list of available Proof of Reserve Feeds, see the [Proof of Reserve
Feed Addresses](/data-feeds/proof-of-reserve/addresses) page.

## Types of Proof of Reserve Feeds

Reserves are available for both cross-chain assets and off-chain assets. This
categorization describes the data attestation variations of Proof of Reserve
feeds and helps highlight some of the inherent market risks surrounding the
data quality of these feeds.

Reserves are available for both off-chain assets and cross-chain assets. Token
issuers prove the reserves for their assets through several different methods.

### Off-chain reserves

Off-Chain reserves are sourced from APIs through an [external
adapter](/chainlink-nodes/external-adapters/external-adapters).

Off-chain reserves provide their data using the following methods:

  * Third-party: An auditor, accounting firm, or other third party attests to reserves. This is done by combining both fiat and investment assets into a numeric value that is reported against the token.
  * Custodian: Reserves data are pulled directly from the bank or custodian. The custodian has direct access to the bank or vault holding the assets. Generally, this works when the underlying asset pulled requires no

### Proof of Reserve Feeds

Proof of Reserves feeds provide the status of reserves for stablecoins,
wrapped assets, and real world assets. Proof of Reserve Feeds operate
similarly to Price Feeds, but provide answers in units of measurement such as
ounces (oz) or number of tokens.

NFT Floor Price Feeds provide the price of the lowest priced NFT available in
a collection. These feeds operate similarly to [Price Feeds](/data-feeds/price-feeds) so you can use the
[AggregatorV3Interface.sol](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/chainlink/blob/master/contracts/src/v0.8/interfaces/AggregatorV3Interface.sol)

#### Risks for Proof of Reserve feeds using the wallet address manager

Cross-chain Proof of Reserve feeds using wallet address manager contracts can
vary in their configurations. If the wallet address manager is self-attested,
these feeds might include reserve balances from on-chain addresses that have
not been cryptographically verified to show ownership or control. In
circumstances where cryptographically verified ownership is not provided,
there is a risk that token issuers could manipulate the value of a Proof of
Reserve feed by adding more addresses to the address list even if they do not
directly control these addresses. Each feed뗩 specific configuration is
documented in the contract address section.

### Cross-chain reserves

Cross-chain reserves are sourced from the network where the reserves are held.
Chainlink node operators can report cross-chain reserves by running an
[external adapter](/chainlink-nodes/external-adapters/external-adapters) and
querying the source-chain client directly. In some instances, the reserves are
composed of a dynamic list of IDs or addresses using a composite adapter.

Cross-chain reserves provide their data using the following methods:

  * Wallet address manager: The project uses the [IPoRAddressList](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/chainlink/blob/develop/contracts/src/v0.8/interfaces/PoRAddressList.sol) wallet address manager contract and self-attests to which addresses they own.
  * Wallet address: The project attests which addresses they own through a self-hosted API.

  * Overview
  * Retrieve the contract address
  * Send funds to your contract

Some smart contracts require funding at their addresses so they can operate
without you having to call functions manually and pay for the transactions
through MetaMask. This guide explains how to fund Solidity contracts with LINK
or ETH.

## Retrieve the contract address

  1. In Remix, deploy your contract and wait until you see a new contract in the **Deployed Contracts** section.
  2. On the left side panel, use the **Copy** button located near the contract title to copy the contract address to your clipboard.

## Send funds to your contract

  1. Open MetaMask.
  2. Select the network that you want to send funds on. For example, select the Sepolia testnet.
  3. Click the **Send** button to initiate a transaction.
  4. Paste your contract address in the address field.
  5. In the **Asset** drop down menu, select the type of asset that you need to send to your contract. For example, you can send LINK. If LINK is not listed, follow the guide to [Acquire testnet LINK](/resources/acquire-link).
  6. In the **Amount** field, enter the amount of LINK that you want to send.
  7. Click **Next** to review the transaction details and the Gas cost.
  8. If the transaction details are correct, click **Confirm** and wait for the transaction to process.

Transaction fee didn't update?

You may need to click **Fastest** , **Fast** , **Slow** , or **Advanced
Options** after entering the **Amount** to update the gas limit for the token
transfer to be successful.

A contract itself can't 'automatically have LINK transferred to it', because
to transfer LINK from one account to another, the owner of the LINK must be
the one that signs the transaction, however, there are a few other ways to
achieve the end result you're looking for.

1 - Rather than a straight transfer, you can do a swap on a DEX like Uniswap
programatically, ie <https://docs.uniswap.org/protocol/V2/guides/smart-
contract-integration/trading-from-a-smart-contract>

2 - If you know how much LINK will be required for the contract, you can
simply pre-fund it beforehand, or when it's created. Am guessing this isn't
the case for you though.

3 - Do it external to the blockchain. ie you can have a process running that
funds the contract with link every so often, checking if its empty or near
empty

4 - You can make use of meta-transactions so that the people playing the game
don't need any LINK. See [this example](https://github.com/pappas999/Link-Gas-
Station). Take note this still uses an external relayer like I mentioned in
the last point

coordinator contracts are well funded with LINK, and then they manually just
top them up as needed, using users deposited eth/funds as a kind of payment to
offset them having to send LINK to the contract.

## What is a smart contract? What is a hybrid smart contract?

When deployed to a blockchain, a _smart contract_ is a set of instructions
that can be executed without intervention from third parties. The smart
contract code defines how it responds to input, just like the code of any
other computer program.

A valuable feature of smart contracts is that they can store and manage on-
chain assets (like [ETH or ERC20
tokens](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/standards/tokens/erc-20/)),
just like you can with an Ethereum wallet. Because they have an on-chain
address like a wallet, they can do everything any other address can. This
enables you to program automated actions when receiving and transferring
assets.

Smart contracts can connect to real-world market prices of assets to produce
powerful applications. Securely connecting smart contracts with off-chain data
and services is what makes them _hybrid_ smart contracts. This is done using
oracles.

## What language is a smart contract written in?

The most popular language for writing smart contracts on Ethereum and EVM
Chains is [Solidity](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.7/). It was created
by the Ethereum Foundation specifically for smart contract development and is
constantly being updated. Other languages exist for writing smart contracts on
Ethereum and EVM Chains, but Solidity is the language used for Chainlink smart
contracts.

If you've ever written Javascript, Java, or other object-oriented scripting
languages, Solidity should be easy to understand. Similar to object-oriented
languages, Solidity is considered to be a _contract_ -oriented language.

Some networks are not EVM-compatible and use languages other than Solidity for
smart contracts:

the blockchain.

## What is a LINK token?

The LINK token is an ERC677 token that inherits functionality from the [ERC20
token
standard](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/standards/tokens/erc-20/)
and allows token transfers to contain a data payload. It is used to pay node
operators for retrieving data for smart contracts and also for deposits placed
by node operators as required by contract creators.

Any wallet that handles ERC20 tokens can store LINK tokens. The ERC677 token
standard that the LINK token implements still retains all functionality of
ERC20 tokens.

## What are oracles?

**Oracles** provide a bridge between the real-world and on-chain smart
contracts by being a source of data that smart contracts can rely on, and act
upon.

Oracles play a critical role in facilitating the full potential of smart
contract utility. Without a reliable connection to real-world conditions,
smart contracts cannot effectively serve the real-world.

## How do smart contracts use oracles?

Oracles are most popularly used with [_Data Feeds_](/data-feeds). DeFi
platforms like [AAVE](https://aave.com/) and
[Synthetix](https://www.synthetix.io/) use Chainlink data feed oracles to
obtain accurate real-time asset prices in their smart contracts.

Chainlink data feeds are sources of data [aggregated from many independent
Chainlink node operators](/architecture-overview/architecture-decentralized-model). Each data feed has an on-chain address and functions that enable
contracts to read from that address. For example, the [ETH / USD
feed](https://data.chain.link/eth-usd/).



Smart contracts also use oracles to get other capabilities on-chain:

My suggestion is, maybe a little awkward, but for the sake of
decentralization, could work.

  * You charge your Contract1 with a sufficient link to get started

  * Charge every minter the equivalent link transaction cost in eth (+ the % that covers the costs of the trade to link and transfer between contracts)

  * As they mint, it is incorporated into the price and the eth is sent to Contract2.

  * In Contract2 simply exists a public callable function to initiate a swap for the link via routerV2 or a similar contract.

  * By placing a call to this function and contract, you can then just let any minter activate the swap contract function

  * The eth in Contract2 will be sent back to Contract1 as a link.

  * You could have a counter go and then call Contract2 every time the link fund is low and refill it automatically.

  * If you build it into the mint, then the inter will cover the fees.

You can:

  1. Move the costs directly to the caller

_Require`LINK` payment, or some other form of payment that will cover the
costs of oracle request_

  2. Request the oracle data in a smaller frequency (if your use case allows it)

_Are you receiving some price info from

`ETH/USD` goerli testnet address:""0xD4a33860578De61DBAbDc8BFdb98FD742fA7028e""

  * Now in order to call chainlink oracle you have to have `LINK` token in your contract. Get some link token to your conract address [from the faucet](https://faucets.chain.link/)

  * Import the token in metamask. you will see the amount

  * send link token from your metamask to your contract

  * deploy your contract. if you are using `Remix IDE` chose the `injected provider` to connect to metamask. Because chainlink contract is on goerli, so you need to be on Goerli testnet. Once deployment goes through you can call the `fund` function.

  * Since the `fund` function has no argument, you need to send the value alongside the transaction. That is why inside the function you have `msg.value` to access to the sent amount.

  * In `Remix` ide, under ""GAS LIMIT`input there is`VALUE`input. you need to pass the amount in there before you call the`fund` function.

with, and what external APIs it might call.

  2. **Compile:** Pass your smart contract code through a compiler to translate the contract into byte code that the blockchain can understand. For example, [Solidity](https://soliditylang.org) code must be compiled before it can run in the [Ethereum Virtual Machine](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/evm/).

  3. **Deploy:** Send the compiled smart contract to the blockchain. From that point forward, the contract cannot be altered. However, you can still interact with the contract in several ways.

  4. **Run functions:** When you run the functions that you defined for the contract, the network processes those functions and modifies the state of your contract. For some functions, the network charges a small fee to complete the work. Your contract can also have functions that transfer funds to other contracts or wallets.

This guide walks you through each step, but you must install and fund your
MetaMask wallet first.

## Install and fund your MetaMask wallet

Deploying smart contracts on-chain requires a wallet and ETH. The ETH pays for
the work required by the Ethereum network to add the contract to the
blockchain and store the variables. The wallet holds the ETH that you need to
pay for the transaction. Install MetaMask, configure it to use the [Sepolia
testnet](https://sepolia.dev/), and fund your wallet with free testnet ETH.

  1. [Install and configure the MetaMask extension](https://metamask.io/download) in your browser.

  2. After you install the extension, open your browser extension list and click MetaMask to open MetaMask.

  3. Follow the instructions in MetaMask to create a new MetaMask wallet. The new wallet includes a 12-word mnemonic phrase. This phrase is the key to your wallet. Copy that phrase down in a very secure location that only you can access. You can use this phrase to retrieve your wallet later or add it to another browser.

  4. Set MetaMask to use

items:

  * The oracle address.
  * The job ID, so the oracle knows which tasks to perform.
  * The callback function, which the oracle sends the response to.

To learn about how to find oracles to suit your needs, see [Find Existing
Jobs](/any-api/find-oracle).

Oracle contracts are responsible for handling on-chain requests made through
the LINK token, by implementing `onTokenTransfer` as a
[`LinkTokenReceiver`](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/chainlink/blob/master/contracts/src/v0.6/LinkTokenReceiver.sol).
Upon execution of this function, the oracle contract **emits an`OracleRequest`
event** containing information about the request. This event is crucial, as it
is monitored by the off-chain oracle node which acts upon it.

#### Fulfillment

For fulfillment, the oracle contract has a `fulfillOracleRequest` function
which is used by the node to fulfill a request once it has the result of the
job. This function returns the result to the `ChainlinkClient` using the
callback function defined in the original request.

### Off-Chain Oracle Node

The off-chain oracle node is responsible for listening for events emitted by
its corresponding on-chain smart contract. Once it detects an `OracleRequest`
event, it uses the data emitted to perform a job.

The most common job type for a Node is to make a GET request to an API,
retrieve some data from it, parse the response, convert the result into
blockchain compatible data, then submit it in a transaction back to the oracle
contract, using the `fulfillOracleRequest` function.

  2. The `Messenger` smart contract sends the request the `PreCoordinator` smart contract .

  3. The `PreCoordinator` forwards the request to the Oracles defined in a Service Agreement (proxy of Oracles).

  4. Upon receiving LINK, each Oracle sends the request to the Chainlink node, by emitting an `OracleRequest` event with the id of the job to be executed.

  5. The Chainlink node captures such event, and executes the corresponding job.

  6. Once the job is executed, the Chainlink node calls the `fulfillOracleRequest2` function to return the result from the external adapter to the PreCoordinator.

  7. The PreCoordinator takes the mean of all Oracle results and ultimately registers the SLI in the messenger.

## Fulfillment Issue

It appears our node doesn't pick the OracleRequest event of our PreCoordinator
v0.6 / Operator v0.7 setup.

The request is never fulfilled so we've been wondering if our job id syntax is
correct in the PreCoordinator service agreements (among other things) and if,
perhaps, there's a peculiar configuration to apply to the node / v2 job specs.

To learn how to use L2 sequencer uptime feeds feeds, see the [L2 Sequencer
Uptime Feeds](/data-feeds/l2-sequencer-feeds) documentation.

## Components of a data feed

Data Feeds are an example of a decentralized oracle network and include the
following components:

  * **Consumer** : A consumer is an on-chain or off-chain application that uses Data Feeds. Consumer contracts use the [`AggregatorV3Interface`](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/chainlink/blob/master/contracts/src/v0.8/interfaces/AggregatorV3Interface.sol) to call functions on the proxy contract and retrieve information from the aggregator contract. For a complete list of functions available in the `AggregatorV3Interface`, see the [Data Feeds API Reference](/data-feeds/api-reference/#aggregatorv3interface).
  * **Proxy contract** : Proxy contracts are on-chain proxies that point to the aggregator for a particular data feed. Using proxies enables the underlying aggregator to be upgraded without any service interruption to consuming contracts. Proxy contracts can vary from one data feed to another, but the [`AggregatorProxy.sol` contract](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/chainlink/blob/develop/contracts/src/v0.7/dev/AggregatorProxy.sol) on Github is a common example.
  * **Aggregator contract** : An aggregator is a contract that receives periodic data updates from the oracle network. Aggregators store aggregated data on-chain so that consumers can retrieve it and act upon it within the same transaction. For a complete list of functions and variables available on most aggregator contracts, see the [Data Feeds API Reference](/data-feeds/api-reference/#accesscontrolledoffchainaggregator).

do not yet meet the same
liquidity and stability standards as verified feeds, and users must understand
the additional market and volatility risks inherent with such assets. Users of
provisional feeds are responsible for independently verifying the liquidity
and stability of the feeds that they use. The use of a provisional feed is at
your own risk.

At the end of the 90-day probationary period, the status of provisional feeds
may be adjusted to verified, monitored, or be deprecated entirely.

### 游댯 Custom Feeds

Custom Feeds are built to serve a specific use case and might not be suitable
for general use or your use case's risk parameters. Users must evaluate the
properties of a feed to make sure it aligns with their intended use case.
[Contact the Chainlink Labs team](https://chain.link/contact?ref_id=DataFeed)
if you want more detail on any specific feeds in this category.

Custom feeds have the following categories and compositions:

  * **On-chain single source feeds:** These feeds take their data from an on-chain source, however the feed has only a single data provider currently supporting the feed.
  * **On-chain Proof of Reserve Feeds:** Chainlink Proof of Reserve uses the largest decentralized collection of security-reviewed and Sybil-resistant node operators in the industry to acquire and verify reserve data. In this use case, reserves reside on-chain.
  * **Technical Feeds:** Feeds within this category measure a particular technical metric from a specified blockchain. For example, Fast Gas or Block Difficulty.
  * **Total Value Locked Feeds:** These feeds measure the total value locked in a particular protocol.
  * **Custom Index Feeds:** An index calculates a function of the values for multiple underlying assets. The function is specific to that index and is typically calculated by node operators following an agreed formula.

contracts.

## How is randomness generated on blockchains? What is Chainlink VRF?

Randomness is very difficult to generate on blockchains. This is because every
node on the blockchain must come to the same conclusion and form a consensus.
Even though random numbers are versatile and useful in a variety of blockchain
applications, they cannot be generated natively in smart contracts. The
solution to this issue is [**Chainlink VRF**](/vrf/v2/introduction), also
known as Chainlink Verifiable Random Function.

## What is the Request and Receive cycle?

The [previous guide](/getting-started/consuming-data-feeds) explained how to
consume Chainlink Data Feeds, which consist of reference data posted on-chain
by oracles. This data is stored in a contract and can be referenced by
consumers until the oracle updates the data again.

Randomness, on the other hand, cannot be reference data. If the result of
randomness is stored on-chain, any actor could retrieve the value and predict
the outcome. Instead, randomness must be requested from an oracle, which
generates a number and a cryptographic proof. Then, the oracle returns that
result to the contract that requested it. This sequence is known as the
**[Request and Receive cycle](/architecture-overview/architecture-request-model)**.

## What is the payment process for generating a random number?

VRF requests receive funding from subscription accounts. The [Subscription
Manager](https://vrf.chain.link) lets you create an account and pre-pay for
VRF requests, so that funding of all your application requests are managed in
a single location. To learn more about VRF requests funding, see
[Subscriptions limits](/vrf/v2/subscription#subscription-limits).

  </div>
</ContentWrapp>

As discussed in the previous lesson randomness provided by an outside service needs to be verifiable and decentralized, and that뗩 exactly what Chainlink VRF is! VRF stands for Verifiable Randomness Function. Essentially Chainlink VRF provides cryptographic proof alongside every random number generated, that the random number wasn뗪 tampered with (and indeed generated in a random way).

How does this cryptographic proof work? It뗩 quite mathematically complicated and outside the scope of this lesson, but you can read more about it in the Technical Walkthrough section of this [blog post](https://blog.chain.link/chainlink-vrf-on-chain-verifiable-randomness/). The cryptographic proof is then verified by a smart contract on-chain, which means it is verified by every node on the blockchain! This completes our verifiable and decentralized criteria. So now we understand that Chainlink VRF is verifiably random and decentralized how do we use it?


:::NEXT DOC:::

understand this a little better. You can imagine VRF as a public-key pseudorandom function. It can be used to prove that the output was calculated for that given function. But only the owner of the secret key can compute the output for any given input value. Others can use the public key to check if the output was calculated using the given function. So it allows us to produce unpredictable (and uniformly distributed) results while being fully verifiable.

In Chainlink, a contract is used to provide a seed (via an Ethereum log) to generate a random number. The oracle hashes this input to get a cryptographically secure random sample from secp256k1 using the block data and the oracle's public key. This is the base to use the VRF to create a random number. The oracle then sends back the proof with the public key and the input seed (and some additional values for the signature). Afterward, it gets verified by the VRF machinery and is sent to the consuming contract if it was correct. The random number is then published on-chain with proof that it was generated using the VRF.

# Introduction to Chainlink VRF

  * Overview
  * Two methods to request randomness
  * Choosing the correct method
  * Supported networks

Get Started

Access verified randomness at [vrf.chain.link](https://vrf.chain.link).

**Chainlink VRF (Verifiable Random Function)** is a provably fair and
verifiable random number generator (RNG) that enables smart contracts to
access random values without compromising security or usability. For each
request, Chainlink VRF generates one or more random values and cryptographic
proof of how those values were determined. The proof is published and verified
on-chain before any consuming applications can use it. This process ensures
that results cannot be tampered with or manipulated by any single entity
including oracle operators, miners, users, or smart contract developers.

Security Considerations

Be sure to review your contracts with the [security
considerations](/vrf/v2/security/) in mind.

Use Chainlink VRF to build reliable smart contracts for any applications that
rely on unpredictable outcomes:

  * Building blockchain games and NFTs.
  * Random assignment of duties and resources. For example, randomly assigning judges to cases.
  * Choosing a representative sample for consensus mechanisms.

To learn more about the benefits of Chainlink VRF v2, see our blog post

Number](/vrf/v1/examples/get-a-random-number).

## On-chain Verification of Randomness

Chainlink VRF enables smart contracts to access randomness without
compromising on security or usability. With every new request for randomness,
Chainlink VRF generates a random number and cryptographic proof of how that
number was determined. The proof is published and verified on-chain before it
can be used by any consuming applications. This process ensures that the
results cannot be tampered with nor manipulated by anyone, including oracle
operators, miners, users and even smart contract developers.

Chainlink VRF is essentially the DON itself (the computers running the Chainlink nodes) and 2 main smart contracts:

- The Client Contract (VRFConsumerBaseV2)
- The VRF Coordinator Contract (VRFCoordinatorV2)

VRF Client Contract:

The contract you are building must import and inherit the client contract. It allows your contract to send the proper requests and receive answers from the Chainlink VRF. To send requests it allows your contract to utilize a function called RequestRandomness. To receive answers your contract will need to have a FulfillRandomness function. To import the Client Contract you need only one line at the top of your Solidity code:

<Highlight class=""language-javascript"">
import ""@chainlink/contracts/src/v0.8/VRFConsumerBaseV2.sol"";

And to inherit the contract you must put the following when naming your contract:

of each random number returned from a random node.

You can find the addresses of these contracts on each chain in the [Chainlink
documentation under ""Contract Addresses""](https://docs.chain.link/docs/vrf-
contracts/)

based on something (could be user input or on-chain data, it doesn't
matter) before the call to the oracle is made (the call passes the seed to the
oracle). Once the oracle generates a random number, the VRF function can then
use math and cryptography to actually verify that the random number was
created based from the initial seed, and that it's not just some random number
plucked from the air (and potentially malicious). This is the magic of VRF,
being able to verify a random number was created with a previously committed
seed. So combining a VRF function with an oracle is the best possible way for
a safe and secure source of randomness in a smart contract.

[Chainlink VRF](https://chain.link/chainlink-vrf) is the industry standard for
randomness on blockchains, and I highly suggest you look into it. If it's cost
you're worried about, I think its cheaper to use on other chains like Polygon
or BSC. Also if you speak to the Chainlink Labs team, they can possibly work
out some agreement that is more feasible for bootstrapped projects

Client Contract:

The contract you are building must import and inherit the client contract. It allows your contract to send the proper requests and receive answers from the Chainlink VRF. To send requests it allows your contract to utilize a function called RequestRandomness. To receive answers your contract will need to have a FulfillRandomness function. To import the Client Contract you need only one line at the top of your Solidity code:

<Highlight class=""language-javascript"">
import ""@chainlink/contracts/src/v0.8/VRFConsumerBaseV2.sol"";
</Highlight>

And to inherit the contract you must put the following when naming your contract:

<Highlight class=""language-javascript"">
contract VRFv2Consumer is VRFConsumerBaseV2
</Highlight>

VRF Coordinator Contract:

The Coordinator contract has two main duties. Manage subscriptions to the Chainlink VRF and verify every random number alongside its proof. A VRF subscription represents a contract that wants to receive a random number, how many random numbers it wants to receive, and how many LINK tokens have been pre-paid for that contact (as for every Chainlink service LINK tokens are used to pay the Chainlink VRF for every random number requested). So it essentially coordinates the random numbers sent out by Chainlink VRF!

### useChainlinkWithENS


    function useChainlinkWithENS(
      address _ens,
      bytes32 _node
    )

Allows a Chainlink contract to store the addresses of the LINK token and
oracle contract addresses without supplying the addresses themselves. We use
ENS where available to resolve these addresses. It requires the address of the
ENS contract and the node (which is a hash) for the domain.

If your Oracle provider supports using ENS for rolling upgrades to their
oracle contract, once you've pointed your Chainlinked contract to the ENS
records then you can update the records using updateChainlinkOracleWithENS.

Updating oracle addresses

If an oracle provider supports listing their oracle on ENS, that provides the
added security of being able to update any issues that may arise. The tradeoff
here is that by using their ENS record, you are allowing whoever controls that
record and the corresponding code it points to. If your contract does this,
you must either audit the updated code and make sure it matches
[Oracle.sol](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/chainlink/blob/develop/contracts/src/v0.6/Oracle.sol)
or trust whoever can update the records.

`cancelChainlinkRequest`
will send the cancel request to the address used for the request, which
transfers the amount of LINK back to the requesting contract, and delete it
from the tracked requests.

The default expiration for a request is five minutes, after which it can be
cancelled. The cancellation must be sent by the address which was specified as
the callback location of the contract.

For the sake of efficient gas usage, only a hash of the request's parameters
are stored on-chain. In order to validate the terms of the request and that it
can be calculated, the request parameters must be provided. Additionally,
cancellation must be called by the address which the callback would otherwise
have been called on.

`cancelChainlinkRequest` emits a ChainlinkCancelled event.

# What is Chainlink Functions?

  * Overview
  * When to use Chainlink Functions
  * Supported networks

Get Started

Chainlink Functions is available on testnet as a limited BETA preview. Apply
[here](https://chainlinkcommunity.typeform.com/requestaccess) to request
access and get started.

Chainlink Functions provides your smart contracts with access to a trust-
minimized compute infrastructure. Your smart contract sends your code to a
[Decentralized Oracle Network (DON)](/chainlink-functions/resources/concepts),
and each DON's oracle runs the same code in a serverless environment. The DON
aggregates all the independent runs and returns the final result to your smart
contract. Your code can be anything from simple computation to fetching data
from API providers.

Chainlink Functions provides access to off-chain computation without having to
run and configure your own Chainlink Node. To pay for requests, you fund a
subscription account with LINK. Your subscription is billed only when the DON
fulfills your request.

To learn more about how _Chainlink Functions_ works, read the
[concepts](/chainlink-functions/resources/concepts) and the
[architecture](/chainlink-functions/resources/architecture) pages.

See the [Tutorials](/chainlink-functions/tutorials) page to find some simple
tutorials that show you different GET and POST requests that run on _Chainlink
Functions_.

## When to use Chainlink Functions

note

Chainlink Functions is a self-service solution. You are responsible for
independently reviewing any JavaScript code that you write and submit in a
request. This includes API dependencies that you send to be executed by
Chainlink Functions. Community-created Javascript code examples might not be
audited, so you must independently review this code before you use it.

Chainlink Functions is offered ""as is"" and ""as available"" without conditions
or warranties of any kind. Neither Chainlink Labs, the Chainlink Foundation,
nor Chainlink node operators are responsible for unintended outputs that are
generated by Functions due to errors in Javascript code submitted by
developers or downstream issues with API dependencies. Users must ensure that
the data sources specified in requests are of sufficient quality and have the
proper availability for your use case. Users are responsible for complying
with the licensing agreements for all data providers that they connect with
through Chainlink Functions.

_Chainlink Functions_ enables a variety of use cases. Use _Chainlink
Functions_ to:

  * Connect to any public data. For example, you can connect your smart contracts to weather statistics for parametric insurance or real-time sports results for Dynamic NFTs.
  * Connect to public data and transform it before consumption. You could calculate Twitter sentiment after reading data from the Twitter API, or derive asset prices after reading price data from [Chainlink Price Feeds](/data-feeds/price-feeds).
  * Connect to a password-protected data source; from IoT devices like smartwatches to enterprise resource planning systems.

Testnet BETA Preview

Chainlink Functions is available on testnet only as a limited BETA preview to
ensure that this new platform is robust and secure for developers. While on
testnet and in BETA, developers must follow best practices and not use the
BETA for any production application or secure any value. Chainlink Functions
is likely to evolve and improve. Breaking changes might occur while the
service is in BETA. Monitor these docs to stay updated on feature improvements
along with interface and contract changes. Apply

  * **Minimum spend requirement** : As part of the mission to continuously enhance the security of the Chainlink Network for all participants, each registered upkeep will have a minimum spend requirement of 0.1 LINK, in aggregate across all transactions for the upkeep, to discourage network spam. Note that an _upkeep_ is the automation job itself. It is not a transaction. Each upkeep can have thousands of transactions. If an upkeep has not spent more than 0.1 LINK across all transactions at the time of cancellation, then 0.1 LINK will be retained for the network. If more than 0.1 LINK has been spent by an upkeep, the full remaining balance of the upkeep will be withdrawable when the upkeep is canceled.

### Manually migrating upkeeps from v1.1 to v1.2

If your upkeep ID has 77 digits, it is already migrated to v1.2 and no further
action is required. If your upkeep ID has less than 4 digits, your upkeep is
on the v1.1 registry. To migrate your upkeep from Keepers v1.1 to Keepers
v1.2, you can cancel it in the Keepers App, and register an exact copy of the
upkeep in the Keepers App. While you can see upkeeps from both v1.1 and v1.2
in the [Keepers App](https://automation.chain.link), all new upkeeps in the
Keepers App will be automatically created on Keepers v1.2.

  3. **Approve the LINK spend allowance**

  4. **Confirm the LINK transfer** by sending funds to the Chainlink Automation Network Registry 

  5. **Receive a success message** and verify that the funds were added to the Upkeep 

## Maintain a Minimum Balance

Each Upkeep has a [minimum balance](/chainlink-automation/automation-economics/#minimum-balance) to ensure that an Upkeeps will still run should a
sudden spike occur. If your Upkeep LINK balance drops below this amount, the
Upkeep will not be performed.

To account for Upkeep execution over time and possible extended gas spikes,
maintain an Upkeep LINK balance that is 3 to 5 times the minimum balance. Note
if you have an upkeep that performs frequently you may want to increase the
buffer to ensure a reasonable interval before you need to fund again.
Developers also have the ability to update `performGasLimit` for an upkeep.

## Withdraw funds

To withdraw funds, the Upkeep administrator have to cancel the Upkeep first.
There is a 50 block delay once an Upkeep has been cancelled before funds can
be withdrawn. Once 50 blocks have passed, select **Withdraw funds**.

## Interacting directly with the Chainlink Automation Registry

After registration, you can interact directly with the [registry
contract](/chainlink-automation/supported-networks/#configurations) functions
such as `cancelUpkeep` and `addFunds` using your **Upkeep ID**. The Registry
Address might change when new contracts are deployed with new functionality.

  * **Advanced turn-taking algorithm** : Our turn taking algorithm now supports upkeeps that require high-frequency execution.

  * **Durable ID and user-triggered migration** : All upkeeps created in versions v1.2 and later will have durable IDs. v1.2 also supports user-triggered migration to future registry versions to make it easier to migrate to a new Keepers Registry and benefit from new features. Future migrations can still retain the existing ID. The ID is now a hash in format of a 77 digit integer.

Find the following addresses for your network:

  * Correct [LINK token contract](/resources/link-token-contracts)
  * [Registry and registrar addresses for your network](/chainlink-automation/supported-networks/#configurations)

Optionally, you can fetch the LINK address and registrar address from the
intended registry at run-time.

Fund your contract

Make sure your contract has enough [ERC-677 LINK](/resources/link-token-contracts) to fund the Upkeep at creation. _The minimum amount is 0.1 LINK._

Mainnets and testnets use different versions of the Registry and Registrar
interfaces.

  * Mainnets: Use the v1.x registrar and registry interfaces.

# Managing Upkeeps

  * Overview
  * Fund your Upkeep
  * Maintain a Minimum Balance
  * Withdraw funds
  * Interacting directly with the Chainlink Automation Registry

Manage your Upkeeps to get the best performance.

## Fund your Upkeep

You must monitor the balance of your Upkeep. If the Upkeep LINK balance drops
below the [minimum balance](/chainlink-automation/automation-economics/#minimum-balance), the Chainlink Automation Network will not perform
the Upkeep.

ERC677 Link

For funding on Mainnet, you need ERC-677 LINK. Many token bridges give you
ERC-20 LINK tokens. Use PegSwap to [convert Chainlink tokens (LINK) to be
ERC-677 compatible](https://pegswap.chain.link/). To fund on a supported
testnet, get [LINK](/resources/link-token-contracts) from
[faucets.chain.link](https://faucets.chain.link/).

Follow these steps to fund your Upkeep:

  1. **Click`View Upkeep`** or go to the [Chainlink Automation App](https://automation.chain.link) and click on your recently registered Upkeep under My Upkeeps.

  2. **Click the`Add funds` button**

  3. **Approve the LINK spend allowance**

  4. **Confirm the LINK transfer** by sending funds to the Chainlink Automation Network Registry 

  5. **Receive a success message** and verify that the funds were added to the Upkeep 

## Maintain a Minimum Balance

Each Upkeep has a [minimum balance](/chainlink-automation/automation-economics/#minimum-balance) to ensure that an Upkeeps will still run should a
sudden spike occur. If your Upkeep LINK balance drops below this amount, the
Upkeep will not be performed.

To account for Upkeep execution over time and possible extended gas

click **Next**.



### Entering Upkeep Details

To complete the upkeep registration process, you must enter some information
about your upkeep including its name, gas limit, starting balance LINK, and
contact information.

Job Scheduler Gas requirements

When you create an upkeep through the Job Scheduler, Chainlink Automation
deploys a new `CronUpkeep` contract from the
[CronUpkeepFactory](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/chainlink/blob/d5a253fb6959104844eda8479c08909a76a6fea7/contracts/src/v0.8/automation/upkeeps/CronUpkeepFactory.sol)
to manage your time schedule and ensure that it is compatible. This contract
uses roughly 110K gas per call, so it is recommended to add 150K additional
gas to the gas limit of the function you are automating.



ERC677 Link

For registration you must use ERC-677 LINK. Read our [LINK](/resources/link-token-contracts) page to determine where to acquire mainnet LINK, or visit
[faucets.chain.link](https://faucets.chain.link/) to request testnet LINK.

What is the purpose of setting the `const consumerAddress` in the `request.js` script?,To set the deployed consumer address,{'source': 'https://docs.chain.link/chainlink-functions/resources/add-functions-to-projects/'},The purpose of setting the `const consumerAddress` in the `request.js` script is not mentioned in the given context information.," 3. Edit the `request.js` script and set your deployed consumer address in `const consumerAddress`:
    
        const consumerAddress = 0x5484e266c2cd379800e6f27eab097bb806647cbf

  4. Set `const subscriptionId` to your Chainlink Functions subscription ID. This must be the same ID that your consumer contract is authorized to use. You can [add a consumer contract to a subscription](/chainlink-functions/resources/subscriptions#add-a-consumer-contract-to-a-subscription) later if you need to.
    
        const subscriptionId = 917

  5. Set `const consumerAbiPath` to the ABI file that you created when you ran `npx hardhat compile`. The ABI tells Ethers how to interact with your deployed contract. If you compiled and deployed `FunctionsConsumer.sol`, set a path like the following example:
    
        const consumerAbiPath = ""./artifacts/contracts/FunctionsConsumer.sol/FunctionsConsumer.json""

  6. Set `const source` with the path to the request source code that you downloaded earlier:
    
        const source = ./Functions-request-source.js

  7. Set `const args` with an array of arguments for the DON to use when it runs your source. If you look at the `Functions-request-source.js` file, you can see that it requires two arguments. The args define which assets to retrieve from the data source URL.
    
        const args = [""ETH"", ""USD""]

  8. Set `const oracleAddress` to the oracle address on the network that you want to use. Each network has a unique DON with a unique oracle address. See the [Supported Networks](/chainlink-functions/supported-networks) page for a list of supported networks and oracle

:::NEXT DOC:::

     requestId,

                data
            );
        }
    
    

I removed the `oracleRequest()` function because it exceeds stack size by
adding more modifiers to it and since I can use `operatorRequest()` to fulfill
both multi-word and single-word requests I will make that method deprecated by
reverting everytime it's called.

The modifier that sets the authorized consumer is basically the following:

    
    
        /**
         * @dev function used to change the authorized consumer. Can only be set once
         */
        function setAuthorizedConsumer(address _consumer) public onlyOwner {

                authorizedConsumer == address(0),
                ""authorized consumer is already set""
            );
            authorizedConsumer = _consumer;
        }

You can restrict the access by adding whitelisted requesters (authorized smart
contract addresses) to the database of the Chainlink node that is picking up
your requests and running the job calling your external adapter.

We wrote a short guide on how to do

:::NEXT DOC:::

You can retrieve extra funds later when you cancel the subscription.
    
        const linkAmount = ""1""

  5. Set `const consumer` to the address of the consumer contract that you deployed:
    
        const consumer = ""0x5484e266c2cD379800e6F27EaB097Bb806647CbF""

  6. Save the file and run the script. Include the `--network` flag to use a network other than the default in the Hardhat config:
    
        npx hardhat run scripts/functions-sub.js --network your_network

Example:

    
        npx hardhat run scripts/functions-sub.js --network polygonMumbai

  7. If the script is successful, you the terminal prints your subscription ID. Record this ID to use for Chainlink Functions requests. You should see output similar to the following example:
    
        Subscription created with ID: 917
    Duplicate definition of Transfer (Transfer(address,address,uint256,bytes), Transfer(address,address,uint256))
    Funding with 1000000000000000000 Juels (1 LINK = 10^18 Juels)
    Subscription 917 funded with 1000000000000000000 Juels (1 LINK = 10^18 Juels)
    Adding consumer contract address 0x5484e266c2cD379800e6F27EaB097Bb806647CbF to subscription 917
    Authorized consumer contract: 0x5484e266c2cD379800e6F27EaB097Bb806647CbF

Now that the consumer contract is deployed and the subscription is created and
funded with LINK, the on-chain resources are ready to handle your requests.
Next, create JavaScript code that you want to run on the DON,

I think this is because your prompt variable will be undefined when the
request object gets assigned to `requestConfig` because prompt gets given a
value asynchronously.

The tooling reads your request config statically. What you need to do is to
find the bit in the tasks where the request config is read and just before i
gets passed to the ConsumerContract's executeRequest function. Intercept the
requestObject there and (by using async await first to get the value of
`prompt` set) set the value of args once the `prompt` value has been set.

Question: (Asked on: 2021-11-26 22:23:13)
Purpose of &quot;memory path&quot; variable in ATestnetConsumer.sol example
URL: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/70130560/purpose-of-memory-path-variable-in-atestnetconsumer-sol-example

Question Body:


Hello I'm working to create my own custom chainlink job and associated
consumer.sol contract. I am using the example ""ATestnetConsumer.sol"" contract
as a guide.
(<https://github.com/smartcontractkit/documentation/blob/main/_includes/samples/APIRequests/ATestnetConsumer.sol>)
I am confused regarding the purpose of the req variable and the path string
array. What is the purpose of these when the chainlink node executes the job?

    
    
    function requestEthereumLastMarket(address _oracle, string memory _jobId)
        public
        onlyOwner
      {
        Chainlink.Request memory req = buildChainlinkRequest(stringToBytes32(_jobId), address(this), this.fulfillEthereumLastMarket.selector);
        req.add(""get"", ""https://min-api.cryptocompare.com/data/pricemultifull?fsyms=ETH&tsyms=USD"");
        string[] memory path = new string[](4);
        path[0] = ""RAW"";
        path[1] = ""ETH"";
        path[2] = ""USD"";
        path[3] = ""LASTMARKET"";

            );
            owner = msg.sender;
        }
    
    }
    

And if you see, the parameter that I need to send to `AggregatorV3Interface`
is static `0xD4a33860578De61DBAbDc8BFdb98FD742fA7028e`. To me, that doesn't
look optimized enough. Because right now, I'm playing with this function for
`Goerli`, but if I were to deploy this contract to Etherium mainnet, I would
have to change that address manually. Even if you go to chainlink website,
they have it like this. <https://docs.chain.link/data-feeds/price-
feeds/#solidity>

Is there a better way? I would like to have some variable that I would set,
and read from it? Or maybe some custom variable setting from hardhat, that I'm
using.

`priceFeed = AggregatorV3Interface(env.proccess.address);` Would be desired,
or anything dynamic.

Subscriptions have the following core concepts:

  * **Subscription id:** 64-bit unsigned integer representing the unique identifier of the subscription.
  * **Subscription accounts:** An account that holds LINK tokens and makes them available to fund requests to Chainlink VRF v2 coordinators.
  * **Subscription owner:** The wallet address that creates and manages a subscription account. Any account can add LINK to the subscription balance, but only the owner can add approved consuming contracts or withdraw funds.
  * **Consumers:** Consuming contracts that are approved to use funding from your subscription account.
  * **Subscription balance:** The amount of LINK maintained on your subscription account. Requests from consuming contracts will continue to be funded until the balance runs out, so be sure to maintain sufficient funds in your subscription balance to pay for the requests and keep your applications running.

For Chainlink VRF v2 to fulfill your requests, you must maintain a sufficient
amount of LINK in your subscription balance. Gas cost calculation includes the
following variables:

  * **Gas price:** The current gas price, which fluctuates depending on network conditions.

  * **Callback gas:** The amount of gas used for the callback request that returns your requested random values.

  * **Verification gas:** The amount of gas used to verify randomness on-chain.

# Subscription Manager Contract

Now that we learned more about the theoretical background, let뗩 get practical. We want to create and manage a subscription contract. We will use the example contract that you can find here on [Remix](https://remix.ethereum.org/#url=https://docs.chain.link/samples/VRF/VRFv2SubscriptionManager.sol&optimize=false&runs=200&evmVersion=null&version=soljson-v0.8.7+commit.e28d00a7.js). It shows an example implementation of a VRF v2 Subscription manager for the Goerli network. But you can also adjust it to work with other networks by changing the code's hardcoded addresses. You can find a complete list of available networks [here](https://docs.chain.link/docs/vrf-contracts/#configurations).

Hint: This course assumes you are already familiar with the Architecture of Chainlink VRF from [VRFv2 Introduction Chapter 4](https://www.chainlink.education/vrfIntroduction/chapter-4).

Generally, consumer contracts must implement the requestRandomWords() function providing coordinator parameters and subscription ID. This function is used to create random values. A second function, fulfillRandomWords(), must be implemented to receive the random values. Learn about how to implement the basics of such a contract in [chapters 6-12](https://www.chainlink.education/vrfIntroduction/chapter-6) from the introduction course.

We want to focus on the mentioned functions here and show how to manage subscriptions in this contract. So let뗩 start by creating a new subscription:

## Subscriptions

VRF v2 requests receive funding from subscription accounts. The [Subscription
Manager](/vrf/v2/subscription/ui) lets you create an account and pre-pay for
VRF v2, so you don't provide funding each time your application requests
randomness. This reduces the total gas cost to use VRF v2. It also provides a
simple way to fund your use of Chainlink products from a single location, so
you don't have to manage multiple wallets across several different systems and
applications.

[vrf.chain.link](https://vrf.chain.link/). The Subscription Manager lets you
create a subscription and pre-pay for VRF v2 so you don't need to provide
funding each time your application requests randomness. This guide walks you
through the main sections of the UI.

Troubleshooting

your VRF requests.



Subscription components:

  * **Status** : Indicates if the subscription is still active or not.
  * **ID** : The unique subscription identifier. Approved consuming contracts use LINK from this subscription to pay for each randomness request.
  * **Admin** : The account address that owns this subscription ID.
  * **Consumers** : The number of consuming contracts that are approved to make VRF requests using this subscription.
  * **Fulfillment** : The number of successful randomness requests that are already completed.
  * **Balance** : The amount of LINK remaining to be used for requests that use this subscription.

## Modifying subscriptions and configurations

Subscription configurations do not have to be static. You can change your
subscription configuration dynamically by calling the following functions
using the
[VRFCoordinatorV2Interface](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/chainlink/blob/develop/contracts/src/v0.8/interfaces/VRFCoordinatorV2Interface.sol):

  * Change the list of approved subscription consumers with: 
    * `addConsumer(uint64 subId, address consumer)`.
    * `removeConsumer(uint64 subId, address consumer)`.
  * Transfer the subscription ownership with: 
    * `requestSubscriptionOwnerTransfer(uint64 subId, address newOwner)`.
    * `acceptSubscriptionOwnerTransfer(uint64 subId)`.
  * View the subscription with `getSubscription(uint64 subId)`.
  * Cancel the subscription with `cancelSubscription(uint64 subId)`.

To send LINK to the subscription balance, use the LINK token interface with
`LINKTOKEN.transferAndCall(address(COORDINATOR), amount, abi.encode(subId))`.
Any wallet can fund a subscription.

See the example in the Subscription manager contract section to learn how to
create a contract that can change your subscription configuration.

## Subscription manager contract

In this example, the contract operates as a subscription owner and can run
functions to add consuming contracts to the subscription. The consuming
contracts must include the `requestRandomWords()` function with the correct
coordinator parameters and the correct subscription ID to request random
values and use the subscription balance. The consuming contracts must also
include the `fulfillRandomWords()` function to receive the random values.

Subscription owners and consumers do not have to be separate. This contract
not only allows adding consumers with `addConsumer(address consumerAddress)`
but can also act as a consumer by running its

page to learn more.

  * **Multiple Random Outputs in a Single Request:** The [VRF Coordinator contracts](/vrf/v2/subscription/supported-networks) in VRF v2 allow you to request multiple random numbers (multi-word) in a single on-chain transaction, which reduces gas costs. The fulfillment is also a single transaction, which reduces the latency of responses.

  * **Unified Billing - Delegate Subscription Balance to Multiple Addresses:** Chainlink VRF v2 allows up to 100 smart contract addresses to fund their requests for verifiable randomness from a single LINK subscription balance, which is managed by the subscription owner.

Read the [Chainlink VRF v2 blog post](https://blog.chain.link/vrf-v2-mainnet-launch/) for a detailed explanation about the benefits and use cases for VRF
v2.

#####Chapter 5: VRF Subscriptions

# Subscribing to the VRF
Just like all Chainlink powered services, we must pay the Chainlink VRF for the work completed by using the LINK token. In the past, in version one of Chainlink VRF, this involved sending a set amount of LINK tokens alongside each request. And because a contract itself sends out the requests, this meant that smart contracts had to be sent LINK before they could request a random number. 

## VRFv2
In VRFv2, the most recent version of the VRF, the concept of a subscription was added. What is a subscription? Essentially, it's an account created on the VRFCoordinator contract that can be funded with LINK tokens and points to ""consumer"" contracts that want to request randomness. Once a subscription is set-up a consumer contract can then request randomness, the VRF respondes with a random number and proof, and then after the random number is included on-chain the VRF is paid with some of the LINK prepaid in the subscription.

The power that comes from this subscription model is that now consumer contracts have much more flexibility in requesting random numbers. Before subscriptions it was a static price, and the VRF always returned a single random number. 
 
But what if the consumer contract needs more than one random number? The consumer contract can now specify how many random numbers it wants to request.  
 
What if the consumer contract needs the random number to be included very fast by paying a higher gas price? The consumer contract can now request how much it's willing to pay for gas. This is called the **gas lane**. 
 
What if the consumer contract needs to run some heavy calculations after recieving the random number? It can set a limit to how much gas will be spent by the VRF when submitting the random number. This is called the

Security Considerations

Be sure to review your contracts with the [security
considerations](/vrf/v2/security/) in mind.

How you manage the subscription depends on your randomness needs. You can
configure your subscriptions using the [Subscription
Manager](/vrf/v2/subscription/ui), but these examples demonstrate how to
create your subscription and add your consumer contracts programmatically. For
these examples, the contract owns and manages the subscription. Any wallet can
provide funding to those subscriptions.

You can view and monitor your subscriptions in the [Subscription
Manager](/vrf/v2/subscription/ui) even if you create them programmatically. Go

## Requirements

This guide assumes that you know how to create and deploy smart contracts on
Ethereum testnets using the following tools:

  * [The Remix IDE](https://remix.ethereum.org/)
  * [MetaMask](https://metamask.io/)
  * [Sepolia testnet ETH](/resources/link-token-contracts/#sepolia-testnet)

If you are new to developing smart contracts on Ethereum, see the [Getting
Started](/getting-started/conceptual-overview) guide to learn the basics.

## Create and fund a subscription

For this example, create a new subscription on the Sepolia testnet.

  1. Open MetaMask and set it to use the Sepolia testnet. The [Subscription Manager](/vrf/v2/subscription/ui) detects your network based on the active network in MetaMask.

  2. Check MetaMask to make sure you have testnet ETH and LINK on Sepolia. You can get testnet ETH and LINK at [faucets.chain.link](https://faucets.chain.link/sepolia/).

# Fulfilling Requests

  * Overview

  * Address Types
  * Setup your Operator contract
  * Deploy your own Operator contract
  * Whitelist your node address in the Operator contract
  * Add a job to the node
  * Create a request to your node
  * Withdrawing LINK

Run a Chainlink node

This guide assumes you have a running Chainlink node. To learn how to run a
node, see the [Running a Chainlink Node locally](/chainlink-nodes/v1/running-a-chainlink-node) guide.

You can use your Chainlink nodes to fulfill requests. This guide shows you how
to deploy your own operator contract and add jobs to your node so that it can
provide data to smart contracts.

Chainlink nodes can fulfill requests from open or unauthenticated APIs without
the need for [External Adapters](/chainlink-nodes/external-adapters/external-adapters) as long as you've added the jobs to the node. For these requests,
requesters supply the URL to the open API that they want each node to
retrieve. The Chainlink node will use [tasks](/chainlink-nodes/oracle-jobs/tasks) to fulfill the request.

Some APIs require authentication by providing request headers for the
operator's API key, which the Chainlink node supports. If you would like to
provide access to an API that requires authentication, you must create a job
that is specific for that API either using an [external adapter](/chainlink-nodes/external-adapters/external-adapters) or by using the parameters of the
[HTTP task](/chainlink-nodes/oracle-jobs/all-tasks/#http-task).

# Security and Operation Best Practices

  * Overview
  * Restricting Access
  * Failover Capabilities
  * Disaster Recovery
  * Active Monitoring
  * Frequent Updates
  * Jobs and Config
  * Addresses
  * Infrastructure as Code (IaC)

The following information provides a set of security and operation best
practices that node operators need to use at a minimum to enhance the security
and reliability of their infrastructure.

## Restricting Access

To run a Chainlink node, the Operator UI port does not need to be open on the
internet for it to correctly function. Due to this, we strongly recommend
restricting access to all of the services required over the internet.

**Minimum Requirements:**

  * SSH (port 22 or changed from the default) is open, and access to the node is granted via SSH tunnelling. This is done typically by adding `-L 6688:localhost:6688` to your SSH command.
  * Access to the Ethereum client that the Chainlink node uses is restricted to solely the Chainlink node. This includes ports 8545 and 8546, but excludes 30303 for P2P traffic.

**Recommended:**

  * The use of a VPN restricts access to only those who are signed into the VPN in order to access internal resources. For example, this can be achieved by using something like [OpenVPN Access Server](https://openvpn.net/vpn-server/).
  * With the use of the VPN, all traffic between Chainlink nodes and Ethereum clients is routed internally rather than over the internet. For example, all servers are placed in an internal subnet range such as `10.0.0.0/16` and use these IP addresses for communicating.
  * Chainlink nodes have the potential to send arbitrary HTTP GET and POST requests, exposing internal network resources. We recommend deploying with a DMZ which has strong outbound network restrictions.

So using Chainlink, we can create a price oracle that isn뗪 just Jim but Jim and 30 other of the most trusted and expert crypto price data aggregators out there and make them come to an agreement.

Chainlink allows developers to create and customize any type of <ColorWord>Decentralized Oracle Network</ColorWord>, or DONs, a smart contract might need. Developers can choose which nodes are a part of a network, what type of data each node is looking for, how nodes come to an agreement, when nodes should post updates, and any other computation nodes should perform. Finally, with Chainlink, developers can build smart contracts that can interact with the outside world to preserve the decentralized nature of smart contracts.

# Optimizing EVM Performance

  * Overview
  * Using multiple nodes
  * Automatic load balancing and failover
  * Configuring websocket and HTTP URLs
  * Increasing transaction throughput
  * Increase ETH_MAX_QUEUED_TRANSACTIONS
  * Increase ETH_MAX_IN_FLIGHT_TRANSACTIONS
  * Optimizing RPC nodes
  * Remove rejections on expensive transactions
  * Arbitrum differences
  * Adjusting minimum outgoing confirmations for high throughput jobs
  * Increase ORM_MAX_OPEN_CONNS and ORM_MAX_IDLE_CONNS

The most basic Chainlink node deployment uses the default configuration on
only a single primary node with a websocket URL. This configuration is
appropriate for small or simple workloads with only a few jobs that execute
infrequently. If you need to run hundreds of jobs and thousands of
transactions per hour, your Chainlink and RPC nodes will require a more
advanced configuration. This guide explains how to configure Chainlink and
your EVM nodes for high reliability and throughput.

Note on Ethereum clients

Ethereum clients have bugs. Much work is done on the Chainlink node software
to mitigate bugs in various different RPC implementations. This guide helps
you understand how to mitigate and work around these bugs.

## Using multiple nodes

Use multiple nodes

Providing multiple primary nodes can improve performance and reliability.

Chainlink node version 1.3.0 and later support configurations with multiple
primary nodes and send-only nodes with automatic liveness detection and
failover. It is no longer necessary to run a load balancing failover RPC proxy
between Chainlink and its EVM RPC nodes.

If you are using a failover proxy transparently for commercial node provider
services, it will continue to work properly as long as the RPC you are talking
to acts just like a standard RPC node.

You can have as many primary nodes

 * The use of a VPN restricts access to only those who are signed into the VPN in order to access internal resources. For example, this can be achieved by using something like [OpenVPN Access Server](https://openvpn.net/vpn-server/).
  * With the use of the VPN, all traffic between Chainlink nodes and Ethereum clients is routed internally rather than over the internet. For example, all servers are placed in an internal subnet range such as `10.0.0.0/16` and use these IP addresses for communicating.
  * Chainlink nodes have the potential to send arbitrary HTTP GET and POST requests, exposing internal network resources. We recommend deploying with a DMZ which has strong outbound network restrictions.

## Failover Capabilities

To ensure there is very minimal downtime, failover capabilities are required
on both the Chainlink and Ethereum clients so that if any one server fails,
the service is still online.

**Minimum Requirements:**

  * Chainlink nodes are using a PostgreSQL database that are not on the same servers as the Chainlink nodes.
  * At least two Chainlink nodes are running at any one time, with both of them pointing to the same database to ensure failover if one fails.

**Ethereum-specific:**

  * Ethereum client websocket connectivity is fronted by a load balancer, used by the Chainlink nodes. [Here is an example on how to set up a load balancer](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/latest/application/tutorial-target-ecs-containers.html). 
    * If a VPN and internal routing is configured, SSL is not needed but still recommended, as all traffic is purely internal.
    * If both Ethereum and Chainlink nodes are public facing without a VPN, SSL is required to ensure that no communication between both can be intercepted.

# What is Chainlink Functions?

  * Overview
  * When to use Chainlink Functions
  * Supported networks

Get Started

Chainlink Functions is available on testnet as a limited BETA preview. Apply
[here](https://chainlinkcommunity.typeform.com/requestaccess) to request
access and get started.

Chainlink Functions provides your smart contracts with access to a trust-
minimized compute infrastructure. Your smart contract sends your code to a
[Decentralized Oracle Network (DON)](/chainlink-functions/resources/concepts),
and each DON's oracle runs the same code in a serverless environment. The DON
aggregates all the independent runs and returns the final result to your smart
contract. Your code can be anything from simple computation to fetching data
from API providers.

Chainlink Functions provides access to off-chain computation without having to
run and configure your own Chainlink Node. To pay for requests, you fund a
subscription account with LINK. Your subscription is billed only when the DON
fulfills your request.

To learn more about how _Chainlink Functions_ works, read the
[concepts](/chainlink-functions/resources/concepts) and the
[architecture](/chainlink-functions/resources/architecture) pages.

See the [Tutorials](/chainlink-functions/tutorials) page to find some simple
tutorials that show you different GET and POST requests that run on _Chainlink
Functions_.

## When to use Chainlink Functions

note

Chainlink Functions is a self-service solution. You are responsible for
independently reviewing any JavaScript code that you write and submit in a
request. This includes API dependencies that you send to be executed by
Chainlink Functions. Community-created Javascript code examples might not be
audited, so you must independently review this code before you use it.

Chainlink Functions is offered ""as is"" and ""as available"" without conditions
or warranties

have all of the tools that you need:

  * [Set up MetaMask](/getting-started/deploy-your-first-contract/#install-and-fund-your-metamask-wallet) and [obtain testnet LINK](/resources/acquire-link).

  * [Run a Chainlink Node](/chainlink-nodes/v1/running-a-chainlink-node).

  * Fund the Ethereum address that your Chainlink node uses. You can find the address in the node Operator GUI under the **Key Management** configuration. The address of the node is the `Regular` type. You can obtain test ETH from several [faucets](/resources/link-token-contracts). For this tutorial to work, you will have to fund the node's Ethereum address with Sepolia ETH. Here is an example:

## Address Types

Your node works with several different types of addresses. Each address type
has a specific function:

  * **Node address:** This is the address for your Chainlink node wallet. The node requires native blockchain tokens at all times to respond to requests. For this example, the node uses Sepolia ETH. When you start a Chainlink node, it automatically generates this address. You can find this address on the Node Operator GUI under **Key Management"

only the private key could decrypt it. The private key needs to be created at some point. Public key cryptography uses random numbers as input to calculate and create key pairs. If your source of randomness is something like Math.random(), it will be far more feasible for an attacker to guess your private key by brute-forcing the random numbers which is produced by this function. In other words, it drastically reduces the search space for the attacker. And the more they know about your conditions, the easier it is for them to find the correct private key as they have to search through fewer options.

Luckily, there are also true random number generators that we can use. They usually rely on measuring physical phenomena like atmospheric noise. It uses a natural source of entropy to avoid any brute-force attacks. This is critical to generating random numbers. Unpredictability is an essential requirement for true random number generators. Unpredictable means no one can reproduce the result by taking the same system as an input. So you cannot simply measure the same atmospheric noise to produce similar results. They will be completely different. So the quality of entropy becomes a fundamental metric. Once this is given, there are different tools to translate this into random numbers.

#####Chapter 2:

# Randomness and Deterministic Machines

Computers are deterministic machines. Per definition, they cannot produce randomness without any external inputs. Once this external input is given, Computer Science has found different methods to generate random numbers. We distinguish between true random number generators (RNG) and pseudo-random number generators (PRNG). You can use a PRNG if your random generator does not need any security guarantees. For example, if you are programming a simple coin-flipping game that you want to use daily to decide between two options, you can use a PRNG like JavaScripts Math.random(). It uses computational algorithms to produce apparently random results. These results are entirely depending on an initial seed. So if the seed is known, the same result can be reproduced.

This might work for prototypes and many practical applications. But imagine you want to encrypt a message. You would use a public key to encrypt the message and only the private key could decrypt it. The private key needs to be created at some point. Public key cryptography uses random numbers as input to calculate and create key pairs. If your source of randomness is something like Math.random(), it will be far more feasible for an attacker to guess your private key by brute-forcing the random numbers which is produced by this function. In other words, it drastically reduces the search space for the attacker.

This so all of the nodes that run the blockchain can come to an agreement on what the blockchain is. But deterministic runs counter to random. If everyone knows what the next hand of poker will be before it is dealt it wouldn뗪 be considered random. So if randomness is impossible on a blockchain, how can we bring the awesome powers of smart contracts to any applications that need randomness?

We could get the randomness from an outside resource! But it can뗪 be a trusted centralized service (as discussed in Chainlink 101), or we would be ruining the decentralized properties of blockchains and smart contracts. And it would be great if it could be verified that the number wasn뗪 tampered with and is genuinely random. This is a perfect example of where a decentralized oracle network powered by Chainlink could be used!

# Randomness and Blockchains

Blockchains heavily rely on cryptography and randomness for security. The most straightforward example is the creation of key pairs used to do transactions. When you create a new key pair, a random number is needed as the initial input. We have learned in the previous example how to obtain this number from, e.g., the physical world. This number is then used to calculate a seed which is further used to derive all further key pairs.

This works well for key creation, but how to use random numbers on-chain? While the initial number could be completely random, as soon as you add it to a transaction, everyone who observes the mempool can see it. And also, the miners/validators can see it and decide how to deal with your transaction based on the number. This also would mean that someone controls the creation of the random number. So you must trust this source. So the random number cannot be created on-chain and must be provided from the outside. Is there no other way?

You might argue that you can use the content of a block as a source of randomness. But these values can be actively manipulated by miners. They could add or remove transactions to find a result that benefits them. In addition, blocks also have particular properties that could reduce the search space to calculate probabilities that a specific number will be selected. So this is an insecure way of creating random numbers.

So if you cannot trust the miners, you could argue for using Oracles. A trusted third-party system could be used to create random numbers and then provide them to services via an oracle. But depending on the economic incentive, someone could be interested in hacking this system to provide non-random numbers as input. And while they might use a true random number generator, you don뗪 know for sure and

So we must address two further issues here. The single point of failure (single oracle) and validating that the number was generated with a particular function. For the first issue, you could argue that you could use decentralized oracle network (DON). So it wouldn뗪 be a single oracle that we need to trust.
But how do we know this DON is not generating numbers based on certain conditions? For this reason, Verifiable Random Functions are used. They allow everyone to verify that a specific VRF was used and that the number was produced by a particular VRF and no other function. This allows us to generate verifiable random numbers for on-chain usage in a decentralized way.

increase the chances of an attacker cheating your application. Imagine you implemented a simple coin flip smart contract using VRF v2. In a bet function, you choose heads or tails and then request a random number. If you have selected heads (0) and the result of the VRF service meant that you would win the bet, it could try to withhold this answer and replace it with your second request if it뗩 more advantageous.

So you see, we must consider the unique properties of blockchains here to ensure randomness in our smart contracts. While the numbers are always random, we must also look into how our applications and smart contracts deal with them. In the end, it will be a matter of cost if it's worth attacking your application. You must also be aware of the protocol that you are using.

In general, re-organizations on chains are possible. A miner would take your request and try to create a new random number with a different block and do this until they find a block to their advantage. They cannot control the VRF output but can ""re-roll"" the dice. If they manage to produce a valid blockchain with this new block and the network accepts this block instead, they could effectively attack your application by controlling the random input.
While this is a possible attack, it's costly to attack a network like this, as in the proof of network. You need at least 51% of the network to drive such an attack. Depending on your application requirements, you consider a 20-block confirmation time highly secure. You can lower the block confirmation time depending on the value you are trying to protect. You must calculate an attacker's costs and potential reward to decide your confirmation time.


:::NEXT DOC:::

due to the fact a
blockchain is deterministic. This means you should not rely on any on-chain
values for a source of randomness (like block hashes or timestamps etc), as
they can be manipulated or pre-determined by miners and used to game your
contract that relies on randomness.

In addition to this, just using an oracle to get a source of randomness from
an external API is also strongly discouraged, because there's no real way of
knowing if the returned number is _actually_ random, of it's been sent back by
a malicious actor wanting to game your contract that relies on it. Ie if your
oracle returned **123456789** , how do you know if its a truly random number,
or if its returning that because it knows it can then call your contract and
take funds if that random number is used?

This is where a _verifiable random number_ comes into play. With a verifiable
random number, an oracle is used, however there is a
[seed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_seed#:%7E:text=A%20random%20seed%20)
generated based on something (could be user input or on-chain data, it doesn't
matter) before the call to the oracle is made (the call passes the seed to the
oracle). Once the oracle generates a random number, the VRF function can then
use math and cryptography to actually verify that the random number was
created based from the initial seed, and that it's not just some random number
plucked from the air (and potentially malicious). This is the magic of VRF,
being able to verify a random number was created with a previously committed
seed. So combining a VRF function with an oracle is the best possible way for
a safe and secure source of randomness in a smart contract.

pseudo-random in a post-merge ETH?

When a validator is due to propose a block, they face a [fairly minimal
penalty](https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/questions/90781/what-is-the-
penalty-of-having-eth2-validator-offline) for failing to do so. Given a smart
contract that is trying to make itself unpredictable/uncontrollable via
`PREVRANDAO`, this option allows them to cheaply bias the behavior of the
contract in the following ways.

### 1\. You always need a validator to propose two blocks in a row

`PREVRANDAO`'s value has no
[entropy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entropy_\(computing\)) given the
`PREVRANDAO` value from the previous block if no block is proposed. When you
propose a block, that's a piece of the math equation that `PREVRANDAO` uses to
make a random number. So if you don't propose a block, you get a ""less"" random
number.

So users of `PREVRANDAO` would need to check that a validator has provided a
block since the last time they called `PREVRANDAO`. Otherwise, they won't
necessarily be drawing statistically independent random outputs on successive
calls to PREVRANDAO.

This means that the validator committed to proposing a particular block can
effectively set the PREVRANDAO value for the next block to two possible
values:

  * the one which results from its mandated `PREVRANDAO` input value
  * whatever `PREVRANDAO` gets deterministically set to if no block is proposed

This choice alone allows validators to influence the random number, no longer
making the number random.

Even if the contract does something cleverer, like taking the `PREVRANDAO`
output from the first block to

only the private key could decrypt it. The private key needs to be created at some point. Public key cryptography uses random numbers as input to calculate and create key pairs. If your source of randomness is something like Math.random(), it will be far more feasible for an attacker to guess your private key by brute-forcing the random numbers which is produced by this function. In other words, it drastically reduces the search space for the attacker. And the more they know about your conditions, the easier it is for them to find the correct private key as they have to search through fewer options.

Luckily, there are also true random number generators that we can use. They usually rely on measuring physical phenomena like atmospheric noise. It uses a natural source of entropy to avoid any brute-force attacks. This is critical to generating random numbers. Unpredictability is an essential requirement for true random number generators. Unpredictable means no one can reproduce the result by taking the same system as an input. So you cannot simply measure the same atmospheric noise to produce similar results. They will be completely different. So the quality of entropy becomes a fundamental metric. Once this is given, there are different tools to translate this into random numbers.


:::NEXT DOC:::

blockhash (just infeasible to compute for anyone who
doesn't know the secret key.)

### 2\. Validators can choose to not post if a number is unfavorable

Once again, you still run into this issue from pre-merge. The penalty of not
posting a block is almost negligible, so a node might be financially
incentivized not to propose blocks in a lottery-type smart contract if the
`PREVRAND` value isn't what they want. Enough nodes do this and you run into
issues.

Just taking the current `PREVRANDAO` value without looking at recent history
gives a validator some control over the output the contract will use, even if
it doesn't want to abort, because the validator can decide whether or not the
block it proposes contains a transaction which will trigger the use of
PREVRANDAO. The only cost involved there is the transaction fee/tip.

### 3\. If all applications use `PREVRANDAO` as their seed

If all applications use `PREVRANDAO` as their seed, in a way, you could
""chain"" together wins or hacks based on this.

### More information

There is also an interesting thread on this in the [Ethereum
Magicians](https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/eip-4399-supplant-difficulty-

enable the transition to the new state. If the verification was successful, Alice has 3 ETH and Bob has 2 ETH. This is our new state. And everyone can repeat this transition by looking at the previous state and applying the pre-defined transition rules.

Ethereum provides the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) to allow custom implementation of transition rules (see Solidity101, [chapter 1](https://www.chainlink.education/solidityIntroduction/chapter-1)). So we can use Smart Contracts to model the state of the system. But there is an important limitation here. EVM is just quasi Turing Complete. Let뗩 understand what this means.

A Turing Complete system can solve any computational problem. A problem can be as simple as adding two numbers together. Or it can be as complex as calculating an optimal route between two points on a map. Ethereum could be considered Turing Complete because it can execute any program a Turing machine can run. But Ethereum has some unique properties that make it just quasi Turing Complete. Because blocks have a finite memory space, executing a program that is too large to fit in memory is impossible. This is the first limitation.
The second limitation is that Ethereum is a decentralized world computer that must always be online. So it must be ensured that a program is not running forever. As there is no algorithm to determine if a program would halt and not run into an infinite loop (known as the halting problem), Ethereum uses gas to limit the number of computations that can be performed. So every instruction is executed with a cost. It provides a practical solution to the halting problem. Otherwise, bad actors could spam the network and cause a denial of service.

As discussed in the previous lesson randomness provided by an outside service needs to be verifiable and decentralized, and that뗩 exactly what Chainlink VRF is! VRF stands for Verifiable Randomness Function. Essentially Chainlink VRF provides cryptographic proof alongside every random number generated, that the random number wasn뗪 tampered with (and indeed generated in a random way).

How does this cryptographic proof work? It뗩 quite mathematically complicated and outside the scope of this lesson, but you can read more about it in the Technical Walkthrough section of this [blog post](https://blog.chain.link/chainlink-vrf-on-chain-verifiable-randomness/). The cryptographic proof is then verified by a smart contract on-chain, which means it is verified by every node on the blockchain! This completes our verifiable and decentralized criteria. So now we understand that Chainlink VRF is verifiably random and decentralized how do we use it?


:::NEXT DOC:::

understand this a little better. You can imagine VRF as a public-key pseudorandom function. It can be used to prove that the output was calculated for that given function. But only the owner of the secret key can compute the output for any given input value. Others can use the public key to check if the output was calculated using the given function. So it allows us to produce unpredictable (and uniformly distributed) results while being fully verifiable.

In Chainlink, a contract is used to provide a seed (via an Ethereum log) to generate a random number. The oracle hashes this input to get a cryptographically secure random sample from secp256k1 using the block data and the oracle's public key. This is the base to use the VRF to create a random number. The oracle then sends back the proof with the public key and the input seed (and some additional values for the signature). Afterward, it gets verified by the VRF machinery and is sent to the consuming contract if it was correct. The random number is then published on-chain with proof that it was generated using the VRF.

- The VRF Coordinator Contract (VRFCoordinatorV2)

VRF Client Contract:

The contract you are building must import and inherit the client contract. It allows your contract to send the proper requests and receive answers from the Chainlink VRF. To send requests it allows your contract to utilize a function called RequestRandomness. To receive answers your contract will need to have a FulfillRandomness function. To import the Client Contract you need only one line at the top of your Solidity code:

# Introduction to Chainlink VRF

  * Overview
  * Two methods to request randomness
  * Choosing the correct method
  * Supported networks

Get Started

Access verified randomness at [vrf.chain.link](https://vrf.chain.link).

**Chainlink VRF (Verifiable Random Function)** is a provably fair and
verifiable random number generator (RNG) that enables smart contracts to
access random values without compromising security or usability. For each
request, Chainlink VRF generates one or more random values and cryptographic
proof of how those values were determined. The proof is published and verified
on-chain before any consuming applications can use it. This process ensures
that results cannot be tampered with or manipulated by any single entity
including oracle operators, miners, users, or smart contract developers.

Security Considerations

Be sure to review your contracts with the [security
considerations](/vrf/v2/security/) in mind.

Use Chainlink VRF to build reliable smart contracts for any applications that
rely on unpredictable outcomes:

  * Building blockchain games and NFTs.
  * Random assignment of duties and resources. For example, randomly assigning judges to cases.
  * Choosing a representative sample for consensus mechanisms.

how to consume random numbers with Chainlink VRF in smart
contracts.

## How is randomness generated on blockchains? What is Chainlink VRF?

Randomness is very difficult to generate on blockchains. This is because every
node on the blockchain must come to the same conclusion and form a consensus.
Even though random numbers are versatile and useful in a variety of blockchain
applications, they cannot be generated natively in smart contracts. The
solution to this issue is [**Chainlink VRF**](/vrf/v2/introduction), also
known as Chainlink Verifiable Random Function.

## What is the Request and Receive cycle?

The [previous guide](/getting-started/consuming-data-feeds) explained how to
consume Chainlink Data Feeds, which consist of reference data posted on-chain
by oracles. This data is stored in a contract and can be referenced by
consumers until the oracle updates the data again.

Randomness, on the other hand, cannot be reference data. If the result of
randomness is stored on-chain, any actor could retrieve the value and predict
the outcome. Instead, randomness must be requested from an oracle, which
generates a number and a cryptographic proof. Then, the oracle returns that
result to the contract that requested it. This sequence is known as the
**[Request and Receive cycle](/architecture-overview/architecture-request-model)**.

## What is the payment process for generating a random number?

VRF requests receive funding from subscription accounts. The [Subscription
Manager](https://vrf.chain.link) lets you create an account and pre-pay for
VRF requests, so that funding of all your application requests are managed in
a single location. To learn more about VRF requests funding, see
[Subscriptions limits](/vrf/v2/subscription#subscription-limits).

# Goldberg뗩 Verifiable Random Function

As we have seen in the previous chapters, randomness is a non-trivial problem that needs proper consideration and analysis to ensure that the randomness is unpredictable. One of Chainlink's VRF v2 core features are based on scientific research and implement Goldberg's Verifiable Random Function (see details [here](https://eprint.iacr.org/2017/099.pdf)). Goldberg defines VRF as the public-key version of a keyed cryptographic hash. Anyone with the corresponding public key can verify the correctness of the hash. But only the holder of the secret VRF key can compute the hash. The VRF created by Goldberg et al. is being standardized by IETF and is also used by others in production (e.g., Algorand). It provides an ""entirely unpredictable (uniformly distributed) to anyone who doesn't know the seed or secret key.""

Let's try to understand this a little better. You can imagine VRF as a public-key pseudorandom function. It can be used to prove that the output was calculated for that given function. But only the owner of the secret key can compute the output for any given input value. Others can use the public key to check if the output was calculated using the given function. So it allows us to produce unpredictable (and uniformly distributed) results while being fully verifiable.

In Chainlink, a contract is used to provide a seed (via an Ethereum log) to generate a random number. The oracle hashes this input to get a cryptographically secure random sample from secp256k1 using the block data and the oracle's public key. This is the base to use the VRF to create a random number. The oracle then sends back the proof with the public key and the input seed

</ContentWrapp>

In Chainlink 101, we discussed how and why Smart Contracts are revolutionizing the nature of agreements, and the Internet. But how do we write smart contracts? Well, smart contracts are programmed, and while there are now several smart contract programming languages, the most popular language today is Solidity. Ethereum developers created Soldity from the ground up to work with Ethereum, the first major smart contract blockchain! This is a major reason why contracts written in Solidity have become so prominent. If you are familiar with some programming, it may help to know that Solidity is an **object-oriented programming language**. If you are not familiar with what that means, don뗪 worry, we뗣l cover it in a future course.

Throughout this course, we will learn the basics of Solidity syntax and then apply it to some activities. The best way to learn to program is to program! With that said, let's dive right in!




:::NEXT DOC:::

popular language for writing smart contracts on Ethereum and EVM
Chains is [Solidity](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.7/). It was created
by the Ethereum Foundation specifically for smart contract development and is
constantly being updated. Other languages exist for writing smart contracts on
Ethereum and EVM Chains, but Solidity is the language used for Chainlink smart
contracts.

If you've ever written Javascript, Java, or other object-oriented scripting
languages, Solidity should be easy to understand. Similar to object-oriented
languages, Solidity is considered to be a _contract_ -oriented language.

Some networks are not EVM-compatible and use languages other than Solidity for
smart contracts:

  * [Solana](/data-feeds/solana)
    * [Writing Solana contracts in Rust](https://docs.solana.com/developing/on-chain-programs/developing-rust)
    * [Writing Solana contracts in C](https://docs.solana.com/developing/on-chain-programs/developing-c)

## What does a smart contract look like?

The structure of a smart contract is similar to that of a class in Javascript,
with a few differences. For example, the following `HelloWorld` contract is a
simple smart contract that stores a single variable and includes a function to
update the value of that variable.


    // SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
    
    pragma solidity 0.8.7;
    
    /**
     * THIS IS AN EXAMPLE CONTRACT THAT USES UN-AUDITED CODE.
     * DO NOT USE THIS CODE IN PRODUCTION.
     */
    
    contract HelloWorld {
        string public message;
    
        constructor(string memory initialMessage) {

contracts, use Chainlink Data Feeds to get asset price data on-chain.

## What is a smart contract? What is a hybrid smart contract?

When deployed to a blockchain, a _smart contract_ is a set of instructions
that can be executed without intervention from third parties. The smart
contract code defines how it responds to input, just like the code of any
other computer program.

A valuable feature of smart contracts is that they can store and manage on-
chain assets (like [ETH or ERC20
tokens](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/standards/tokens/erc-20/)),
just like you can with an Ethereum wallet. Because they have an on-chain
address like a wallet, they can do everything any other address can. This
enables you to program automated actions when receiving and transferring
assets.

Smart contracts can connect to real-world market prices of assets to produce
powerful applications. Securely connecting smart contracts with off-chain data
and services is what makes them _hybrid_ smart contracts. This is done using
oracles.

## What language is a smart contract written in?

The most popular language for writing smart contracts on Ethereum and EVM
Chains is [Solidity](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.7/). It was created
by the Ethereum Foundation specifically for smart contract development and is

with the use of cryptography and game theory (a combination of math and sociology).

You may have heard of a cryptocurrency called Bitcoin. Bitcoin is built on a blockchain (referred to as the <i>Bitcoin blockchain</i>)! No one entity controls Bitcoin so it can be thought of as a sort of 랋roto-smartcontract. It has all the properties of smart contracts listed before, but only has one use: transferring value between individuals.

Today, there are blockchains where <i>any</i> code or applications can be built from. The code deployed to a blockchain is indeed a Smart Contract. This ability was truly pioneered by the Ethereum blockchain, but there are many other blockchains such as Polygon, Avalanche, Solana, Terra, and many others have the same capability. Smart contracts are often written in a programming language called <ColorWord>Solidity</ColorWord>, but others such as Rust are gaining popularity.

Congrats for making it this far! That뗩 a lot of Solidity concepts! The main gist of this course is that there are really only two things you are ever defining when programming smart contracts (or just programming in general): state (variables) and logic (functions). In future courses, we will go into more detail on more complex variables such as storing structs within arrays and more special functions such as the constructor and events. And as always, you know the best way to learn is by doing! Feel free to go to https://remix.ethereum.org/, and just mess around with writing code there. It may feel overwhelming at first, but don뗪 worry it뗩 just to get a feel for what뗩 to come!

on. When a smart contract is deployed to Ethereum, its bytecode lives there forever; always accessible. Any language other than Solidity that can compile to EVM bytecode can also be used to write smart contracts on blockchains that utilize the EVM. Another language that compiles to EVM bytecode is Vyper. Examples of blockchains that run the EVM are Ethereum, Polygon, and Avalanche (among many others). Many blockchains now use the EVM making Solidity an even more powerful smart contract language! 

Some blockchains have virtual machines other than the EVM and thus have different programming languages and bytecode compilation targets, but for this course, we뗣l stick with Solidity and the EVM.

### Solidity versions

The first thing that every Solidity file must have is the Solidity version
definition. The `HelloWorld.sol` contract uses version `0.8.7`, which is
defined in the contract as `pragma solidity 0.8.7;`

You can see the latest versions of the Solidity compiler
[here](https://github.com/ethereum/solc-bin/blob/gh-pages/bin/list.txt/?target=_blank). You might also notice smart contracts that
are compatible with a range of versions.


    pragma solidity >=0.7.0 <0.9.0;

This means that the code is written for Solidity version 0.7.0, or a newer
version of the language up to, but not including version 0.9.0. The `pragma`

enable the transition to the new state. If the verification was successful, Alice has 3 ETH and Bob has 2 ETH. This is our new state. And everyone can repeat this transition by looking at the previous state and applying the pre-defined transition rules.

Ethereum provides the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) to allow custom implementation of transition rules (see Solidity101, [chapter 1](https://www.chainlink.education/solidityIntroduction/chapter-1)). So we can use Smart Contracts to model the state of the system. But there is an important limitation here. EVM is just quasi Turing Complete. Let뗩 understand what this means.

A Turing Complete system can solve any computational problem. A problem can be as simple as adding two numbers together. Or it can be as complex as calculating an optimal route between two points on a map. Ethereum could be considered Turing Complete because it can execute any program a Turing machine can run. But Ethereum has some unique properties that make it just quasi Turing Complete. Because blocks have a finite memory space, executing a program that is too large to fit in memory is impossible. This is the first limitation.
The second limitation is that Ethereum is a decentralized world computer that must always be online. So it must be ensured that a program is not running forever. As there is no algorithm to determine if a program would halt and not run into an infinite loop (known as the halting problem), Ethereum uses gas to limit the number of computations that can be performed. So every instruction is executed with a cost. It provides a practical solution to the halting problem. Otherwise, bad actors could spam the network and cause a denial of service.

# Deploy Your First Smart Contract

  * Overview
  * Install and fund your MetaMask wallet
  * Write, compile, and deploy your first smart contract
  * Run functions in your contract

You can write your first smart contract and run it in your browser without any
knowledge about Ethereum or blockchains. This guide shows you how easy it is
to develop smart contracts using the [Solidity
language](https://soliditylang.org/), a [MetaMask wallet](https://metamask.io)
and the [Remix Development Environment](https://remix.ethereum.org/). You can
use all of these tools in your browser for free with no signup required.

Already know Solidity and have MetaMask configured?

If you are already familiar with how to deploy Smart Contracts and use
MetaMask, you can skip to the [Consuming Data Feeds](/getting-started/consuming-data-feeds) guide to learn how to connect your smart
contracts to Chainlink data feeds.

In general, you create and deploy your smart contracts operate using the
following process:

  1. **Write:** Write a contract to define how the contract functions, what data it can store, what other contracts it interacts with, and what external APIs it might call.

  2. **Compile:** Pass your smart contract code through a compiler to translate the contract into byte code that the blockchain can understand. For example, [Solidity](https://soliditylang.org) code must be compiled before it can run in the [Ethereum Virtual Machine](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/evm/).

  3. **Deploy:** Send the compiled smart contract to the blockchain. From that point forward, the contract cannot be altered. However, you can still interact with the contract in several ways.

  4. **Run functions:** When you run the functions that you defined for the contract, the network processes those functions and modifies the state of your contract. For some functions, the network charges a small fee to complete the work. Your"

This is like how programs downloaded to your computer can access other programs on your computer. This allows smart contracts to interact in many unique and interesting ways that regular web application back ends may not be able to do so easily. However, this can also open risks of other code using our code in unintended ways.

To help prevent this we can declare 라ccess modifiers when declaring our variables, which limit what code on the blockchain can access and change those variables. The four types of variable access modifiers are:


* Public 
    * The variable/function can be accessed or changed by any other code or wallet on the blockchain.
* Private
    * The variable/function can only be accessed or changed within the current contract
* Internal
    * The variable/function can only be accessed or changed within the current contract or any other contract that inherits the current contract (we뗣l discuss inheritance in another lesson)
* External
    * The variable/function can only be accessed/changed from outside code or blockchain wallets

To declare the access modifier of a variable we put it inbetween the function type and name like this:

<Highlight class=""language-javascript"">
uint public myFavNum;
</Highlight>

If no access modifier is declared then the variable is automatically assigned the private modifier. For example

<Highlight class=""language-javascript"">
uint myFavNum;
</Highlight>
 
Is equivalent to 

<Highlight class=""language-javascript"">
uint private myFavNum;
</Highlight>

We can actually give more information to the Solidity compiler on how we want to use our variables (and later functions). We can tell the compiler how we want our variables to be accessed. Many blockchains, such as Ethereum, act as one monolithic computer. While Ethereum is a network of computers distributed around the world, when you deploy code to a blockchain like Ethereum, that code can access any other code anyone has deployed to that blockchain. This is like how programs downloaded to your computer can access other programs on your computer. This allows smart contracts to interact in many unique and interesting ways that regular web application back ends may not be able to do so easily.

### Variables

Like Javascript, contracts can have state variables and local variables.
**State variables** are variables with values that are permanently stored in
contract storage. The values of **local variables** , however, are present
only until the function is executing. There are also different types of
variables you can use within Solidity, such as `string`, `uint256`, etc. Check
out the [Solidity documentation](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.7/) to
learn more about the different kinds of variables and types.

_Visibility modifiers_ are used to define the level of access to these
variables. Here are some examples of state variables with different visibility
modifiers:


    string public message;
    uint256 internal internalVar;
    uint8 private privateVar;

Learn more about state variables visibility
[here](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/contracts.html#state-variable-visibility).

### Constructors

Another familiar concept to programmers is the **constructor**. When you
deploy a contract, the constructor sets the state of the contract when it is
first created.

In `HelloWorld`, the constructor takes in a `string` as a parameter and sets
the `message` state variable to that string.


    constructor(string memory initialMessage) {
      message = initialMessage;
    }

### Functions

**Functions** can access and modify the state of the contract or call other
functions on external contracts. `HelloWorld` has a function named
`updateMessage`, which updates the current message stored in the state.


    constructor(string memory initialMessage) {
      message = initialMessage;
    }
    
    function updateMessage(string memory newMessage) public {
      message = newMessage;
    }

file must have is the Solidity version
definition. The `HelloWorld.sol` contract uses version `0.8.7`, which is
defined in the contract as `pragma solidity 0.8.7;`

You can see the latest versions of the Solidity compiler
[here](https://github.com/ethereum/solc-bin/blob/gh-pages/bin/list.txt/?target=_blank). You might also notice smart contracts that
are compatible with a range of versions.


    pragma solidity >=0.7.0 <0.9.0;

This means that the code is written for Solidity version 0.7.0, or a newer
version of the language up to, but not including version 0.9.0. The `pragma`
selects the compiler, which defines how the code is treated.

### Naming a Contract

The `contract` keyword defines the name of the contract, which in this example
is `HelloWorld`. This is similar to declaring a `class` in Javascript. The
implementation of `HelloWorld` is inside this definition and denoted with
curly braces.


    contract HelloWorld {
    
    }

### Variables

Like Javascript, contracts can have state variables and local variables.
**State variables** are variables with values that are permanently stored in
contract storage. The values of **local variables** , however, are present
only until the function is executing. There are also different types of
variables you can use within Solidity, such as `string`, `uint256`, etc. Check
out the [Solidity documentation](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.7/) to
learn more about the different kinds of variables and types.

_Visibility modifiers_ are used to define the level of access to these
variables. Here are some examples of state variables with different visibility
modifiers:


    string public message;
    uint256 internal

give it a **name** and **type**. You can name the variable whatever you want, as long as it isn뗪 used more than once. The variable **type** describes what kind of data were are storing. Is it an integer to do math on? Is it simply a yes or no (1 or 0)? Is just a sentence meant to be read? Some important data types in Solidity are:



* int: Integers (...-3,-2,-1,0,1,2,3)
    * These are whole numbers and can be negative.
* uint: Unsigned Integers (0,1,2,3) 
    * These are whole numbers and must be positive.
* string: Strings (Hello my name is Glados. The cake is a lie. I like the number 17)
    * These are phrases that meant to be read. You can store numbers in a string but you can뗪 do math on those numbers.
* bool: Booleans (0 or 1)
    * A boolean is a variable that can only be 0 or 1. You can also think of these as false (0) and true (1).
* address: An Account Address (0xa345643f1.e13)
    * An address represents an accout on Ethereum as a hexadecimal number beginning with 0x. These can be wallet accounts (also known as Externally Owned Accounts or EOAs) or contract accounts (the address where contracts can be found on the blockchain).

+ value;
   }
}
 </Highlight>
 
Modifiers are defined using the **modifier** keyword followed by a function name. In the body of the function, we can run any Solidity code. Usually, we want to do some checks and if they are not met, we want to revert the transaction. If everything is alright, we can use the special keyword **_** to tell solidity to execute the called function. Once the function has finished, we could execute further code inside the modifier to do further checks before the transaction completes. In this example, if someone calls the inc function, it must be the contract owner and we do not allow x to be greater than 42.

The same modifier can be used for other functions by adding it to the header. We can also define multiple modifiers and run them in successive order for the given function.

 <Highlight class=""language-javascript"">
contract ContractA {
  uint public x = 0;
  address public owner;
  constructor() {
      owner = msg.sender;
  }
  modifier onlyOwner() {
      require(msg.sender == owner, ""Only owner allowed."");
      _;
      require(x < 42);
  }
 
  modifier maxValue(uint value) {
      require(value <= x, ""Value must be smaller or equal to x."");
      _;
  }
  
  function inc(uint value) public onlyOwner {
      x = x + value;
  }
 
  function dec(uint value) public onlyOwner maxValue(value) {
      x = x - value;
  }
}
 </Highlight>

See how we defined a new function called dec and added a new modifier

# Function Modifiers

Now that we have learned how to execute code based on given conditions and our contracts grow in complexity, we will find ourselves in situations where we need to run some checks before we allow the execution of a function. Introducing function modifiers. Modifiers can be run before and/or after function calls. They can be used for example to restrict access or validate input.

<Highlight class=""language-javascript"">
contract ContractA {
   uint public x = 0;
   address public owner;
 
   constructor() {
       owner = msg.sender;
   }

       require(msg.sender == owner, ""Only owner allowed."");
       _;
       require(x < 42);
   } 
 
   function inc(uint value) public onlyOwner{
       x = x + value;
   }

Programs, in very broad terms, do two things: store data and change data. We store data in programs by utilizing **variables** and change data by defining logic in **functions**. In smart contracts, when we define variables outside of a function they can be used to store data for that contract, to be accessed at a later time. When defining a variable, you must give it a **name** and **type**. You can name the variable whatever you want, as long as it isn뗪 used more than once. The variable **type** describes what kind of data were are storing. Is it an integer to do math on? Is it simply a yes or no (1 or 0)? Is just a sentence meant to be read? Some important data types in Solidity are:

how can someone read data from the blockchain within a smart contract? And how can we add new (custom) data to the blockchain?

We can use the EVM for this and we program the EVM using Solidity (see solidity101, chapter 2 for more details). Solidity offers us three different locations to store our variables. As block size is limited in Ethereum, every bit counts and we should know how these different ways of storing data affect storage capacity. Variables can be declared as **storage**, **memory** or **calldata** to specify the location of the data. In this course, we will only focus on storage and memory. Calldata and the stack will be covered in a future course.

**Storage** variables are also known as state variables. These variables are mutable though their location is persistent. This means that data will persist between function calls. As block space is very valuable, storage variables are arranged in a compact way into storage slots into blocks of 32 bytes. Variables that take less than 32 bytes are combined into the same slot. Taking the least amount of space. Data is stored in order of the declaration in the contract in successive order. So we have slot 0x0, slot 0x1, slot 0x2, and so on.

```Solidity
contract StorageExample {
    uint256 nubmerOne = 1; // slot 0x0
    string customGreeting = ""Hello Chainlink""; // slot 0x1
    uint256 numberTwo; // slot 0x2

    string constant greeting = ""Hello World""; // no storage

    bool active; // slot 0x3

As we learned in the previous chapter, Ethereum could be described as a state machine. Transactions are then used to transition from one state to another state.

We뗬e gone over storing data as variables, some of the significant fundamental variable types, and how to store data in arrays. But what if we want to create a custom type? That type could be composed of several other fundamental types. For instance, we could have our custom type store a string and a number. We can create these custom, complex types, and they are called **structs**.

You can define a struct by declaring the struct keyword, naming the struct, then putting the structure of the struct within curly braces. For example, we could define a struct called Car composed of three fundamental types: a string for the make, a string for the model, and a uint for the VIN. This is how we would define this struct:

<Highlight class=""language-javascript"">
struct car {
  string make,
  string model,
  uint VIN
}
</Highlight>

And boom, we have created a new type called Car we can use throughout our code. Now to assign a variable to this type is a little different from one of the fundamental data types. We must use syntax like this:

<Highlight class=""language-javascript"">
car myNewCar =

:::NEXT DOC:::

constant variables (greeting) are not stored in storage slots. When a constant state variable is read the EVM uses the assigned value instead. the booleans active and admin just take 1 bit each and bytes16 takes 16 bits, so a total of 18 bits. That뗩 why they are all stored in slot 0x3. The last bytes16 variables bar takes another 16 bits but cannot be stored in slot 0x3 because the max size is 32 bytes. So a new slot is occupied.

Dynamic-sized arrays and structs are handled a little differently though as the size is unknown at the point of declaration. They always start with a slot that takes 32 bytes and their elements are stored in a different storage slot. The beginning of this storage slot is computed using a Keccack-256 hash.

**Memory** variables live only in memory and exist in the scope of a function. They are mutable inside that scope but cannot be called outside of the function. Once a function execution is completed, all variables in memory are released.

```Solidity
function add(uint256 a, uint256 b) pure returns(uint256) {
    uint256 result = a + b;
    return result;
}
```

Any manipulations done to memory variables is not written into the blockchain resulting in less gas consumption. So this is why we always need to ask if we need persistence.

There is an exception though as arrays, structs and mappings are stored in storage. This is important to remember as it might introduce critical bugs into your code when not considered. We will learn more about these data types in the upcoming chapters.

myNewCar.model;

### Variables

Like Javascript, contracts can have state variables and local variables.
**State variables** are variables with values that are permanently stored in
contract storage. The values of **local variables** , however, are present
only until the function is executing. There are also different types of
variables you can use within Solidity, such as `string`, `uint256`, etc. Check
out the [Solidity documentation](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.7/) to
learn more about the different kinds of variables and types.

_Visibility modifiers_ are used to define the level of access to these
variables. Here are some examples of state variables with different visibility
modifiers:


    string public message;
    uint256 internal internalVar;
    uint8 private privateVar;

Learn more about state variables visibility
[here](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/contracts.html#state-variable-visibility).

### Constructors

Another familiar concept to programmers is the **constructor**. When you
deploy a contract, the constructor sets the state of the contract when it is
first created.

In `HelloWorld`, the constructor takes in a `string` as a parameter and sets
the `message` state variable to that string.


    constructor(string memory initialMessage) {
      message = initialMessage;
    }

### Functions

**Functions** can access and modify the state of the contract or call other
functions on external contracts. `HelloWorld` has a function named
`updateMessage`, which updates the current message stored in the state.


    constructor(string memory initialMessage) {
      message = initialMessage;
    }
    
    function updateMessage(string memory newMessage) public {
      message = newMessage;
    }

popular language for writing smart contracts on Ethereum and EVM
Chains is [Solidity](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.7/). It was created
by the Ethereum Foundation specifically for smart contract development and is
constantly being updated. Other languages exist for writing smart contracts on
Ethereum and EVM Chains, but Solidity is the language used for Chainlink smart
contracts.

If you've ever written Javascript, Java, or other object-oriented scripting
languages, Solidity should be easy to understand. Similar to object-oriented
languages, Solidity is considered to be a _contract_ -oriented language.

Some networks are not EVM-compatible and use languages other than Solidity for
smart contracts:

  * [Solana](/data-feeds/solana)
    * [Writing Solana contracts in Rust](https://docs.solana.com/developing/on-chain-programs/developing-rust)
    * [Writing Solana contracts in C](https://docs.solana.com/developing/on-chain-programs/developing-c)

## What does a smart contract look like?

The structure of a smart contract is similar to that of a class in Javascript,
with a few differences. For example, the following `HelloWorld` contract is a
simple smart contract that stores a single variable and includes a function to
update the value of that variable.


    // SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT

Agreements, deals, promises: these are concepts that humans universally have an intuition for across cultures. Maybe you agreed to trade three of your toys for one friend뗩 rare toy as a child. Perhaps you뗬e decided to lend your car to a friend as long as they don뗪 put more than 100 miles on it and return it with a full tank. You may have even agreed with your health coach not to eat more than 2,500 calories per day.

These are all examples of agreements. Agreements can be spoken orally, written down on paper, or even typed in digital documents. The enforcement of such agreements is oftentimes informal and 랑ishy washy. Disagreement is handled outside of courts or other formal institutions: a friend who brings back your car with 600 miles on it and an almost empty tank of gas loses your trust. Your health coach will be very disappointed in you if you뗬e eaten 5,000 calories a day for the past week. Though factors such as

Though factors such as reputation, magnitude, and parties within an agreement can affect its enforcement, there is no guarantee that an agreement will be fulfilled.

Contracts are agreements that are enforceable in a court of law. You may have signed a leasing contract to rent an apartment or house. Restaurateurs typically sign contracts with food suppliers to obtain necessary ingredients at a specific price and time no matter what happens in different food markets. You may sign an employment agreement with a company to establish your pay rate and employee benefits. In any form, once these contractual agreements have been made, they are enforced by a court of law. Any clause that is not fulfilled within a contract can be disputed and discussed within the court.

The [Chainlink VRF
Coordinator](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/chainlink/blob/develop/contracts/src/v0.6/VRFCoordinator.sol)
is a contract that is deployed to a blockchain that will check the randomness
of each random number returned from a random node.

You can find the addresses of these contracts on each chain in the [Chainlink
documentation under ""Contract Addresses""](https://docs.chain.link/docs/vrf-
contracts/)

Your RemixIDE file explorer should display _VRFCoordinatorV2Mock.sol_ and
_VRFv2Consumer.sol_ :

### Deploy VRFCoordinatorV2Mock

  1. Open _VRFCoordinatorV2Mock.sol_.

  2. Under _DEPLOY & RUN TRANSACTIONS_, select _VRFCoordinatorV2Mock_.

  3. Under _DEPLOY_ , fill in the `_BASEFEE` and `_GASPRICELINK`. These variables are used in the _VRFCoordinatorV2Mock_ contract to represent the base fee and the gas price (in LINK tokens) for the VRF requests. You can set: `_BASEFEE=100000000000000000` and `_GASPRICELINK=1000000000`.

  4. Click on _transact_ to deploy the _VRFCoordinatorV2Mock_ contract.

  5. Once deployed, you should see the _VRFCoordinatorV2Mock_ contract under _Deployed Contracts_.

  6. Note the address of the deployed contract.

### Create and fund a subscription

  1. Click on `createSubscription` to create a new subscription.

  2. In the RemixIDE console, read your transaction decoded output to find the subscription ID. In this example, the subscription ID is _1_.

  3. Click on `fundSubscription` to fund your subscription. In this example, you can set the `_subid` to `1` (which is your newly created subscription ID) and the `_amount` to `1000000000000000000`.

### Deploy the VRF consumer contract

  1. In the file explorer, open _VRFv2Consumer.sol_.

  2. Under _DEPLOY & RUN TRANSACTIONS_, select _RandomNumberConsumerV2_.

 

:::NEXT DOC:::

 4. Click on _transact_ to deploy the _RandomNumberConsumerV2_ contract.

  5. After the consumer contract is deployed, you should see the _RandomNumberConsumerV2_ contract under _Deployed Contracts_.

  6. Note the address of the deployed contract.

### Add the consumer contract to your subscription

  1. Under _Deployed Contracts_ , open the functions list of your deployed _VRFCoordinatorV2Mock_ contract.

  2. Click on _addConsumer_ and fill in the `_subid` with your subscription ID and `_consumer` with your deployed consumer contract address.

  4. Note your request ID.

### Fulfill the VRF request

Because you are testing on a local blockchain environment, you must fulfill
the VRF request yourself.

  1. Under _Deployed Contracts_ , open the functions list of your deployed _VRFCoordinatorV2Mock_ contract.

  2. Click `fulfillRandomWords` and fill in `_requestId` with your VRF request ID and `_consumer` with your consumer contract address.

  3. Click on `transact`.

### Check the results

  1. Under _Deployed Contracts_ , open the functions list of your deployed _RandomNumberConsumerV2_ contract.

  2. Click on `s_requestId` to display the last request ID. In this example, the output is _1_.

  3. Each time you make a VRF request, your consumer contract requests two random words. After the request is fulfilled, the two random words are stored in the `s_randomWords` array.

Coordinator (on-chain component)](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/chainlink/blob/develop/contracts/src/v0.8/vrf/VRFCoordinatorV2.sol): A contract designed to interact with the VRF service. It emits an event when a request for randomness is made, and then verifies the random number and proof of how it was generated by the VRF service.
  * VRF service (off-chain component): Listens for requests by subscribing to the VRF Coordinator event logs and calculates a random number based on the block hash and nonce. The VRF service then sends a transaction to the `VRFCoordinator` including the random number and a proof of how it was generated.

### Set up your contract and request

Set up your consuming contract:

  1. Your contract must inherit [VRFConsumerBaseV2](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/chainlink/blob/develop/contracts/src/v0.8/vrf/VRFConsumerBaseV2.sol).

  2. Your contract must implement the implement the `fulfillRandomWords` function, which is the _callback VRF function_. Here, you add logic to handle the random values after they are returned to your contract.

  3. Submit your VRF request by calling `requestRandomWords` of the [VRF Coordinator](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/chainlink/blob/develop/contracts/src/v0.8/vrf/VRFCoordinatorV2.sol). Include the following parameters in your request:

    * `keyHash`: Identifier that maps to a job and a private key on the VRF service and that represents a specified gas lane. If your request is urgent, specify a gas lane with a higher gas price limit. The configuration for your network can be found [here](/vrf/v2/subscription/supported-networks/#configurations).

What are the three different ways to throw an error in Solidity?,"The three different ways to throw an error in Solidity are require, revert, and assert.",{'source': 'https://github.com/oceanByte/chainlink-education/blob/a0b8886bd664423b40c8bd3661fdb7d61e975ea2/src/api/src/shared/course/courses/solidity102/Chapters/Chapter-6/course.md'},"The three different ways to throw an error in Solidity are require, revert, and assert.","#####Chapter 6:

# Errors

In the previous chapter, we learned about function modifiers. We already used the keyword **require** to check for conditions. If a condition is not met, an error is raised. An error will revert all changes made to the state during a transaction. There are three different ways to throw an error: **require**, **revert** and **assert**.

We use require if we want to validate user input and return values from calls to other functions. The syntax asks for a condition and a custom error message as the second argument. If the condition is not met, an error is raised. Otherwise, the next line will be executed.

<Highlight class=""language-javascript"">
require(x <= 42, ""x must be smaller or equal to 42."");
</Highlight>

**Revert** is used in a similar fashion but directly throws an error without checking a condition. It is useful when the condition check is more complex and you do not want to do it in a single line to improve readability or if several conditions have to be met that you want to check one by one. It will return all remaining gas to the caller. You can call it like this:

<Highlight class=""language-javascript"">
if (x <= 42 && x > 0) {
  revert(""x must be greater than 0 and smaller or equal to 42"");
}

**Assert** is used for internal logic and checks code that should never be false. If an assertion fails, it뗩 likely that there is a bug in the contract. We can use asserts to ensure that even if there is a bug, we can simply catch it here and make it more difficult to abuse the bug. For example, it is often used to check for overflow/underflow. The following code shows how can ensure that a is

These two problems severely invalidate the smart contract and are holding up
the completion of coding the latest functions. I have contacted several people
and looked in forums concerning programming on solidity but no one seems to
have an answer to my problem.

I hope that my question can be answered by the community and can help any
other person trying to use ChainLink with Solidity in the future. I am happy
to listen to any advice on the matter.

if you want to achieve certain condition is met in solidity code and send this

here is an example:

    
    
      contract DummyContract {

For the first issue, Solidity compiler said that you declared two variables
with the identifier. In details in your case, you give `ethPrice` for
`mapping` and `uint` variable. To solve this issue, try to change one of these
names in this way:

How fix TypeError and DeclarationError with ChainLink Solidity smart contract?

Question Body:


I have created a smart contract which return to each user the amount deposited
+ a certain amount if the price of ETH decreases during the lock period. I
have two problems with the last part of the code.

The first one concerns mapping the price of ethereum at the moment the user
makes the deposit. I have tried several solutions but none of them seem to
work. The problem arises on line 64 `mapping(uint => uint) ethPrice;`. Console
returns:

seems to work fine and the console returns no errors. I am testing

You can deploy the contract with Remix Ide Online, web3 connection with
Metamask. Can you share your hardhat config file or error logs? This should be
inside your hardhat env.

    
    
        mumbai: {
      url: ""https://rpc-mumbai.matic.today"",
      // url: API_URL, //or Infura API  URL   
      accounts: [`0x${PRIVATE_KEY}`],
        gasPrice: 10000000000,
        gasLimit: 9000000
    },
    

Edit: It's failing because cant estimate gasLimit of the transaction. You can
set it manually. Inside your deploy.js script set the gasPrice and gasLimit.
Depending on you are using web3js or etherjs this code will be different. This
is example of another minting function.

    
    
    FT = await contract.ownerMint(WALLET_ADDRESS,{ gasLimit: 285000, gasPrice: ethers.utils.parseUnits('30', 'gwei')});
    

Edit2: you can always deploy it with remix online with Metamask

Contracts are agreements that are enforceable in a court of law. You may have signed a leasing contract to rent an apartment or house. Restaurateurs typically sign contracts with food suppliers to obtain necessary ingredients at a specific price and time no matter what happens in different food markets. You may sign an employment agreement with a company to establish your pay rate and employee benefits. In any form, once these contractual agreements have been made, they are enforced by a court of law. Any clause that is not fulfilled within a contract can be disputed and discussed within the court.

Smart contracts result from the evolution of digital agreements. A smart contract is a self-executing contract with the terms of the agreement being directly written into computer code. Smart contracts provide the following benefits:

   In traditional agreements, the execution and enforcement of the terms detailed within the contract is highly dependent on the signing parties; this may not happen immediately or at all. In terms of smart contracts, none of the parties have control over the execution or enforcement of contract terms.

          Traditional agreements can be opaque and difficult to access in an attempt to obscure details from users. Smart contracts are transparent and open to the public by default.

contracts to define the actual implementation themselves.
This makes it easier to know what functions to call in a contract. Here's an
example of an interface:


    // SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
    
    pragma solidity 0.8.7;
    
    /**
     * THIS IS AN EXAMPLE CONTRACT THAT USES UN-AUDITED CODE.
     * DO NOT USE THIS CODE IN PRODUCTION.
     */
    
    interface numberComparison {
        function isSameNum(uint a, uint b) external view returns (bool);
    }
    
    contract Test is numberComparison {
        constructor() {}
    
        function isSameNum(uint a, uint b) external pure override returns (bool) {
            if (a == b) {
                return true;
            } else {
                return false;
            }
        }
    }
    

For this example, `override` is necessary in the `Test` contract function
because it overrides the base function contained in the `numberComparison`
interface. The contract uses `pure` instead of `view` because the `isSameNum`
function in the `Test` contract does not return a storage variable.

## What does ""deploying"" mean?

**Deploying** a smart contract is the process of pushing the code to the
blockchain, at which point it resides with an on-chain address. Once it's
deployed, the code cannot be changed and is said to be _immutable_.

As long as the address is known,

can also be written to interact with other contracts on
the blockchain.

## What is a LINK token?

The LINK token is an ERC677 token that inherits functionality from the [ERC20
token
standard](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/standards/tokens/erc-20/)
and allows token transfers to contain a data payload. It is used to pay node
operators for retrieving data for smart contracts and also for deposits placed
by node operators as required by contract creators.

Any wallet that handles ERC20 tokens can store LINK tokens. The ERC677 token
standard that the LINK token implements still retains all functionality of
ERC20 tokens.

## What are oracles?

**Oracles** provide a bridge between the real-world and on-chain smart
contracts by being a source of data that smart contracts can rely on, and act
upon.

Oracles play a critical role in facilitating the full potential of smart
contract utility. Without a reliable connection to real-world conditions,
smart contracts cannot effectively serve the real-world.

## How do smart contracts use oracles?

Oracles are most popularly used with [_Data Feeds_](/data-feeds). DeFi
platforms like [AAVE](https://aave.com/) and
[Synthetix](https://www.synthetix.io/) use Chainlink data feed oracles to
obtain accurate real-time asset prices in their smart contracts.

Chainlink data feeds are sources of data [aggregated from many independent
Chainlink node operators](/architecture-overview/architecture-decentralized-model). Each data feed has an on-chain address and functions that enable
contracts to read from that address. For example, the [ETH / USD
feed](https://data.chain.link/eth-usd/).



Smart contracts also use oracles to get other capabilities on-chain:

# What is Chainlink Functions?

  * Overview
  * When to use Chainlink Functions
  * Supported networks

Get Started

Chainlink Functions is available on testnet as a limited BETA preview. Apply
[here](https://chainlinkcommunity.typeform.com/requestaccess) to request
access and get started.

Chainlink Functions provides your smart contracts with access to a trust-
minimized compute infrastructure. Your smart contract sends your code to a
[Decentralized Oracle Network (DON)](/chainlink-functions/resources/concepts),
and each DON's oracle runs the same code in a serverless environment. The DON
aggregates all the independent runs and returns the final result to your smart
contract. Your code can be anything from simple computation to fetching data
from API providers.

Chainlink Functions provides access to off-chain computation without having to
run and configure your own Chainlink Node. To pay for requests, you fund a
subscription account with LINK. Your subscription is billed only when the DON
fulfills your request.

To learn more about how _Chainlink Functions_ works, read the
[concepts](/chainlink-functions/resources/concepts) and the
[architecture](/chainlink-functions/resources/architecture) pages.

See the [Tutorials](/chainlink-functions/tutorials) page to find some simple
tutorials that show you different GET and POST requests that run on _Chainlink
Functions_.

## When to use Chainlink Functions

note

Chainlink Functions is a self-service solution. You are responsible for
independently reviewing any JavaScript code that you write and submit in a
request. This includes API dependencies that you send to be executed by
Chainlink Functions. Community-created Javascript code examples might not be
audited, so you must independently review this code before you use it.

Chainlink Functions is offered ""as is"" and ""as available"" without conditions
or warranties

These are all examples of agreements. Agreements can be spoken orally, written down on paper, or even typed in digital documents. The enforcement of such agreements is oftentimes informal and 랑ishy washy. Disagreement is handled outside of courts or other formal institutions: a friend who brings back your car with 600 miles on it and an almost empty tank of gas loses your trust.

Contracts are agreements that are enforceable in a court of law. You may have signed a leasing contract to rent an apartment or house. Restaurateurs typically sign contracts with food suppliers to obtain necessary ingredients at a specific price and time no matter what happens in different food markets. You may sign an employment agreement with a company to establish your pay rate and employee benefits. In any form, once these contractual agreements have been made, they are enforced by a court of law. Any clause that is not fulfilled within a contract can be disputed and discussed within the court.

  6. Click **Deploy** to deploy the contract to the Sepolia testnet. MetaMask opens and asks you to confirm payment for deploying the contract. Make sure MetaMask is set to the Sepolia network before you accept the transaction. Because these transactions are on the blockchain, they are not reversible.

  7. In the MetaMask prompt, click **Confirm** to approve the transaction and spend your testnet ETH required to deploy the contract.

  8. After a few seconds, the transaction completes and your contract appears under the **Deployed Contracts** list in Remix. Click the contract dropdown to view its variables and functions.

  9. Click **getLatestPrice** to show the latest price from the aggregator contract. The latest price appears just below the button. The returned price is an integer, so it is missing its decimal point.

You can run your own oracle networks that provide data to smart contracts

Client Contract:

The contract you are building must import and inherit the client contract. It allows your contract to send the proper requests and receive answers from the Chainlink VRF. To send requests it allows your contract to utilize a function called RequestRandomness. To receive answers your contract will need to have a FulfillRandomness function. To import the Client Contract you need only one line at the top of your Solidity code:

<Highlight class=""language-javascript"">
import ""@chainlink/contracts/src/v0.8/VRFConsumerBaseV2.sol"";
</Highlight>

And to inherit the contract you must put the following when naming your contract:

<Highlight class=""language-javascript"">
contract VRFv2Consumer is VRFConsumerBaseV2
</Highlight>

VRF Coordinator Contract:

The Coordinator contract has two main duties. Manage subscriptions to the Chainlink VRF and verify every random number alongside its proof. A VRF subscription represents a contract that wants to receive a random number, how many random numbers it wants to receive, and how many LINK tokens have been pre-paid for that contact (as for every Chainlink service LINK tokens are used to pay the Chainlink VRF for every random number requested). So it essentially coordinates the random numbers sent out by Chainlink VRF!

contract has the following components:

  * The `import` line imports an interface named `AggregatorV3Interface`. Interfaces define functions without their implementation, which leaves inheriting contracts to define the actual implementation themselves. In this case, `AggregatorV3Interface` defines that all v3 Aggregators have the function `latestRoundData`. You can [see the complete code](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/chainlink/blob/develop/contracts/src/v0.8/interfaces/AggregatorV3Interface.sol) for the `AggregatorV3Interface` on GitHub.

  * The `constructor() {}` initializes an interface object named `priceFeed` that uses `AggregatorV3Interface` and connects specifically to a proxy aggregator contract that is already deployed at `0x1b44F3514812d835EB1BDB0acB33d3fA3351Ee43`. The interface allows your contract to run functions on that deployed aggregator contract.

  * The `getLatestPrice()` function calls your `priceFeed` object and runs the `latestRoundData()` function. When you deploy the contract, it initializes the `priceFeed` object to point to the aggregator at `0x1b44F3514812d835EB1BDB0acB33d3fA3351Ee43`, which is the proxy address for the Sepolia BTC / USD data feed. Your contract connects to that address and executes the function. The aggregator connects with several oracle nodes and aggregates the pricing data from those nodes. The response from the aggregator includes several variables, but `getLatestPrice()` returns only the `price` variable.

Thus far, we뗬e mainly been concerned with storing data in variables and accessing that stored data. But what if we want to manipulate data? That is the realm of **functions**. You can write the logic in a function and have it manipulate data in an infinite number of ways. Solidity and the EVM are called [Turing Complete](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7284/what-is-turing-complete ""Turing Complete""), which essentially means they can solve any computational problem (although there뗩 no guarantee that it will complete within a reasonable amount of time). 

You can think of functions as little machines that take in data, run some logic and produce an output. The values that are input into functions are called **arguments**. The logic is put in the **body** of the function. If the function directly returns a value as an output of the function that output is called the **return** value.

The main gist of this course is that there are really only two things you are ever defining when programming smart contracts (or just programming in general): state (variables) and logic (functions). In future courses, we will go into more detail on more complex variables such as storing structs within arrays and more special functions such as the constructor and events.

In Chainlink 101, we discussed how and why Smart Contracts are revolutionizing the nature of agreements, and the Internet. But how do we write smart contracts? Well, smart contracts are programmed, and while there are now several smart contract programming languages, the most popular language today is Solidity. Ethereum developers created Soldity from the ground up to work with Ethereum, the first major smart contract blockchain! This is a major reason why contracts written in Solidity have become so prominent. If you are familiar with some programming, it may help to know that Solidity is an **object-oriented programming language**. If you are not familiar with what that means, don뗪 worry, we뗣l cover it in a future course.

Throughout this course, we will learn the basics of Solidity syntax and then apply it to some activities. The best way to learn to program is to program! With that said, let's dive right in!




:::NEXT DOC:::

the contract when it is
first created.

In `HelloWorld`, the constructor takes in a `string` as a parameter and sets
the `message` state variable to that string.


    constructor(string memory initialMessage) {
      message = initialMessage;
    }

### Functions

**Functions** can access and modify the state of the contract or call other
functions on external contracts. `HelloWorld` has a function named
`updateMessage`, which updates the current message stored in the state.


    constructor(string memory initialMessage) {
      message = initialMessage;
    }
    
    function updateMessage(string memory newMessage) public {
      message = newMessage;
    }

Functions use visibility modifiers to define the access level. Learn more
about functions visibility
[here](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/contracts.html#function-visibility).

### Interfaces

An **interface** is another concept that is familiar to programmers of other
languages. Interfaces define functions without their implementation, which
leaves inheriting contracts to define the actual implementation themselves.
This makes it easier to know what functions to call in a contract. Here's an
example of an interface:


    // SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
    
    pragma solidity 0.8.7;
    
    /**
     * THIS IS AN EXAMPLE CONTRACT THAT USES UN-AUDITED CODE.
     * DO NOT USE THIS CODE IN PRODUCTION.
     */
    
    interface numberComparison {
        function isSameNum(uint a, uint b) external view returns (bool);
    }
    
    contract Test is numberComparison {
        constructor()

:::NEXT DOC:::

popular language for writing smart contracts on Ethereum and EVM
Chains is [Solidity](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.7/). It was created
by the Ethereum Foundation specifically for smart contract development and is
constantly being updated. Other languages exist for writing smart contracts on
Ethereum and EVM Chains, but Solidity is the language used for Chainlink smart
contracts.

If you've ever written Javascript, Java, or other object-oriented scripting
languages, Solidity should be easy to understand. Similar to object-oriented
languages, Solidity is considered to be a _contract_ -oriented language.

Some networks are not EVM-compatible and use languages other than Solidity for
smart contracts:

  * [Solana](/data-feeds/solana)
    * [Writing Solana contracts in Rust](https://docs.solana.com/developing/on-chain-programs/developing-rust)
    * [Writing Solana contracts in C](https://docs.solana.com/developing/on-chain-programs/developing-c)

## What does a smart contract look like?

The structure of a smart contract is similar to that of a class in Javascript,
with a few differences. For example, the following `HelloWorld` contract is a
simple smart contract that stores a single variable and includes a function to
update the value of that variable.


    // SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT

Programs, in very broad terms, do two things: store data and change data. We store data in programs by utilizing **variables** and change data by defining logic in **functions**. In smart contracts, when we define variables outside of a function they can be used to store data for that contract, to be accessed at a later time. When defining a variable, you must give it a **name** and **type**. You can name the variable whatever you want, as long as it isn뗪 used more than once. The variable **type** describes what kind of data were are storing. Is it an integer to do math on? Is it simply a yes or no (1 or 0)? Is just a sentence meant to be read? Some important data types in Solidity are:



* int: Integers (...-3,-2,-1,0,1,2,3)
    * These are whole numbers and can be negative.
* uint: Unsigned Integers (0,1,2,3) 
    * These are whole numbers and must be positive.
* string: Strings (Hello my name is Glados. The cake is a lie. I like the number 17)

can be customized to do anything.

To define a function, we first type the 랁unction keyword, define a name for the function and add a pair of parentheses beside the name as such:

<Highlight class=""language-javascript"">
function addNumbers()
</Highlight>

After this is complete you can define **parameters** for the function. Parameters are the name and types of the arguments we can input into the function. They are variables that only that function can access. For this example, we will define two parameters: 

<Highlight class=""language-javascript"">
function addNumbers(uint num1, uint num2)
</Highlight>

Now we can add any modifiers to the function. In this case we뗣l simply add public for now:

<Highlight class=""language-javascript"">
function addNumbers(uint num1, uint num2) public
</Highlight>

Now we뗣l define what the function returns. Remember a function doesn뗪 **have** to return anything. In this example we will add the parameters and return the result. Since we are adding two uints, the return value will also have to be a uint:

<Highlight class=""language-javascript"">
function addNumbers(uint num1, uint num2) public returns (uint)
</Highlight>

Finally we뗣l create the function body by typing a pair of curly braces and typing our function logic within them:

<Highlight class=""language-javascript"">
function addNumbers(uint num1, uint num2) public returns (uint) {
 answer = num1 + num2;
 return answer;
}
</Highlight>

As you can see the function takes the two parameters, num1 and num2, sums them, stores the sum in a variable called answer, and then returns the value inside the variable answer.

# Deploy Your First Smart Contract

  * Overview
  * Install and fund your MetaMask wallet
  * Write, compile, and deploy your first smart contract
  * Run functions in your contract

You can write your first smart contract and run it in your browser without any
knowledge about Ethereum or blockchains. This guide shows you how easy it is
to develop smart contracts using the [Solidity
language](https://soliditylang.org/), a [MetaMask wallet](https://metamask.io)
and the [Remix Development Environment](https://remix.ethereum.org/). You can
use all of these tools in your browser for free with no signup required.

Already know Solidity and have MetaMask configured?

If you are already familiar with how to deploy Smart Contracts and use
MetaMask, you can skip to the [Consuming Data Feeds](/getting-started/consuming-data-feeds) guide to learn how to connect your smart
contracts to Chainlink data feeds.

In general, you create and deploy your smart contracts operate using the
following process:

  1. **Write:** Write a contract to define how the contract functions, what data it can store, what other contracts it interacts with, and what external APIs it might call.

  2. **Compile:** Pass your smart contract code through a compiler to translate the contract into byte code that the blockchain can understand. For example, [Solidity](https://soliditylang.org) code must be compiled before it can run in the [Ethereum Virtual Machine](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/evm/).

  3. **Deploy:** Send the compiled smart contract to the blockchain. From that point forward, the contract cannot be altered. However, you can still interact with the contract in several ways.

  4. **Run functions:** When you run the functions that you defined for the contract, the network processes those functions and modifies the state of your contract. For some functions, the network charges a small fee to complete the work. Your

### Solidity versions

The first thing that every Solidity file must have is the Solidity version
definition. The `HelloWorld.sol` contract uses version `0.8.7`, which is
defined in the contract as `pragma solidity 0.8.7;`

You can see the latest versions of the Solidity compiler
[here](https://github.com/ethereum/solc-bin/blob/gh-pages/bin/list.txt/?target=_blank). You might also notice smart contracts that
are compatible with a range of versions.


    pragma solidity >=0.7.0 <0.9.0;

This means that the code is written for Solidity version 0.7.0, or a newer
version of the language up to, but not including version 0.9.0. The `pragma`

## Request and receive data

Requests to Chainlink VRF v2 follow the request and receive data cycle. This
end-to-end diagram shows each step in the lifecycle of a VRF direct funding
request:

Two types of accounts exist in the Ethereum ecosystem, and both are used in
VRF:

  * EOA (Externally Owned Account): An externally owned account that has a private key and can control a smart contract. Transactions can be initiated only by EOAs.
  * Smart contract: A smart contract that does not have a private key and executes what it has been designed for as a decentralized application.

The Chainlink VRF v2 solution uses both off-chain and on-chain components:

  * [VRF v2 Wrapper (on-chain component)](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/chainlink/blob/develop/contracts/src/v0.8/vrf/VRFV2Wrapper.sol): A wrapper for the VRF Coordinator that provides an interface for consuming contracts.
  * [VRF v2 Coordinator (on-chain component)](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/chainlink/blob/develop/contracts/src/v0.8/vrf/VRFCoordinatorV2.sol): A contract designed to interact with the VRF service. It emits an event when a request for randomness is made, and then verifies the random number and proof of how it was generated by the VRF service.
  * VRF service (off-chain component): Listens for requests by subscribing to the VRF Coordinator event logs and calculates a random number based on the block hash and nonce. The VRF service then sends a transaction to the `VRFCoordinator` including the random number and a proof of how it was

# Introduction to Chainlink VRF

  * Overview
  * Two methods to request randomness
  * Choosing the correct method
  * Supported networks

Get Started

Access verified randomness at [vrf.chain.link](https://vrf.chain.link).

**Chainlink VRF (Verifiable Random Function)** is a provably fair and
verifiable random number generator (RNG) that enables smart contracts to
access random values without compromising security or usability. For each
request, Chainlink VRF generates one or more random values and cryptographic
proof of how those values were determined. The proof is published and verified
on-chain before any consuming applications can use it. This process ensures
that results cannot be tampered with or manipulated by any single entity
including oracle operators, miners, users, or smart contract developers.

Security Considerations

Be sure to review your contracts with the [security
considerations](/vrf/v2/security/) in mind.

Use Chainlink VRF to build reliable smart contracts for any applications that
rely on unpredictable outcomes:

  * Building blockchain games and NFTs.
  * Random assignment of duties and resources. For example, randomly assigning judges to cases.
  * Choosing a representative sample for consensus mechanisms.

## Two methods to request randomness

Chainlink VRF v2 offers two methods for requesting randomness:

  * [Subscription](/vrf/v2/subscription): Create a subscription account and fund its balance with LINK tokens. Users can then connect multiple consuming contracts to the subscription account. When the consuming contracts request randomness, the transaction costs are calculated after the randomness requests are fulfilled and the subscription balance is deducted accordingly. This method allows you to fund requests for multiple consumer contracts from a single subscription.
  * [Direct funding](/vrf/v2/direct-funding): Consuming contracts directly pay with LINK when they request random values. You must directly fund your consumer contracts and ensure that there are enough LINK tokens to pay for randomness requests.

## Choosing the correct method

Depending on your use case, one method might be more suitable than another.
Consider the following characteristics when you choose a method:

| Subscription method                                                                                                          

:::NEXT DOC:::

Client Contract:

The contract you are building must import and inherit the client contract. It allows your contract to send the proper requests and receive answers from the Chainlink VRF. To send requests it allows your contract to utilize a function called RequestRandomness. To receive answers your contract will need to have a FulfillRandomness function. To import the Client Contract you need only one line at the top of your Solidity code:

<Highlight class=""language-javascript"">
import ""@chainlink/contracts/src/v0.8/VRFConsumerBaseV2.sol"";
</Highlight>

And to inherit the contract you must put the following when naming your contract:

<Highlight class=""language-javascript"">
contract VRFv2Consumer is VRFConsumerBaseV2
</Highlight>

VRF Coordinator Contract:

The Coordinator contract has two main duties. Manage subscriptions to the Chainlink VRF and verify every random number alongside its proof. A VRF subscription represents a contract that wants to receive a random number, how many random numbers it wants to receive, and how many LINK tokens have been pre-paid for that contact (as for every Chainlink service LINK tokens are used to pay the Chainlink VRF for every random number requested). So it essentially coordinates the random numbers sent out by Chainlink VRF!


:::NEXT DOC:::

with a random number, the amount of LINK token to be paid to the VRF can be dynamic based on network conditions. When demand to get transactions into a blockchain is high, and thus gas prices are high, more LINK will be deducted to compensate the gas the VRF has to pay to get it's random number transaction on-chain. Or if you don't want the contract to request random numbers when the gas price is high, you can specify that via the Gas Lane. The more random numbers the contract requests at once the more expensive it will be. And finally the higher the computational load of the function the consumer contract runs when recieving a random number; the more gas it will cost for the VRF to submit a random number.

The subscription model added in Chainlink VRFv2 is a powerful tool, enabling any consumer contract requesting a random number to determine how it wants that random number! 

:::NEXT DOC:::

how to consume random numbers with Chainlink VRF in smart
contracts.

## How is randomness generated on blockchains? What is Chainlink VRF?

Randomness is very difficult to generate on blockchains. This is because every
node on the blockchain must come to the same conclusion and form a consensus.
Even though random numbers are versatile and useful in a variety of blockchain
applications, they cannot be generated natively in smart contracts. The
solution to this issue is [**Chainlink VRF**](/vrf/v2/introduction), also
known as Chainlink Verifiable Random Function.

## What is the Request and Receive cycle?

The [previous guide](/getting-started/consuming-data-feeds) explained how to
consume Chainlink Data Feeds, which consist of reference data posted on-chain
by oracles. This data is stored in a contract and can be referenced by
consumers until the oracle updates the data again.

Randomness, on the other hand, cannot be reference data. If the result of
randomness is stored on-chain, any actor could retrieve the value and predict
the outcome. Instead, randomness must be requested from an oracle, which
generates a number and a cryptographic proof. Then, the oracle returns that
result to the contract that requested it. This sequence is known as the
**[Request and Receive cycle](/architecture-overview/architecture-request-model)**.

## What is the payment process for generating a random number?

VRF requests receive funding from subscription accounts. The [Subscription
Manager](https://vrf.chain.link) lets you create an account and pre-pay for
VRF requests, so that funding of all your application requests are managed in
a single location. To learn more about VRF requests funding, see
[Subscriptions limits](/vrf/v2/subscription#subscription-limits).

# Goldberg뗩 Verifiable Random Function

As we have seen in the previous chapters, randomness is a non-trivial problem that needs proper consideration and analysis to ensure that the randomness is unpredictable. One of Chainlink's VRF v2 core features are based on scientific research and implement Goldberg's Verifiable Random Function (see details [here](https://eprint.iacr.org/2017/099.pdf)). Goldberg defines VRF as the public-key version of a keyed cryptographic hash. Anyone with the corresponding public key can verify the correctness of the hash. But only the holder of the secret VRF key can compute the hash. The VRF created by Goldberg et al. is being standardized by IETF and is also used by others in production (e.g., Algorand). It provides an ""entirely unpredictable (uniformly distributed) to anyone who doesn't know the seed or secret key.""

Let's try to understand this a little better. You can imagine VRF as a public-key pseudorandom function. It can be used to prove that the output was calculated for that given function. But only the owner of the secret key can compute the output for any given input value. Others can use the public key to check if the output was calculated using the given function. So it allows us to produce unpredictable (and uniformly distributed) results while being fully verifiable.

In Chainlink, a contract is used to provide a seed (via an Ethereum log) to generate a random number. The oracle hashes this input to get a cryptographically secure random sample from secp256k1 using the block data and the oracle's public key. This is the base to use the VRF to create a random number. The oracle then sends back the proof with the public key and the input seed

This is the base to use the VRF to create a random number. The oracle then sends back the proof with the public key and the input seed (and some additional values for the signature). Afterward, it gets verified by the VRF machinery and is sent to the consuming contract if it was correct. The random number is then published on-chain with proof that it was generated using the VRF.

increase the chances of an attacker cheating your application. Imagine you implemented a simple coin flip smart contract using VRF v2. In a bet function, you choose heads or tails and then request a random number. If you have selected heads (0) and the result of the VRF service meant that you would win the bet, it could try to withhold this answer and replace it with your second request if it뗩 more advantageous.

So you see, we must consider the unique properties of blockchains here to ensure randomness in our smart contracts. While the numbers are always random, we must also look into how our applications and smart contracts deal with them. In the end, it will be a matter of cost if it's worth attacking your application. You must also be aware of the protocol that you are using.

In general, re-organizations on chains are possible. A miner would take your request and try to create a new random number with a different block and do this until they find a block to their advantage. They cannot control the VRF output but can ""re-roll"" the dice. If they manage to produce a valid blockchain with this new block and the network accepts this block instead, they could effectively attack your application by controlling the random input.
While this is a possible attack, it's costly to attack a network like this, as in the proof of network. You need at least 51% of the network to drive such an attack. Depending on your application requirements, you consider a 20-block confirmation time highly secure. You can lower the block confirmation time depending on the value you are trying to protect. You must calculate an attacker's costs and potential reward to decide your confirmation time.

with a random number, the amount of LINK token to be paid to the VRF can be dynamic based on network conditions. When demand to get transactions into a blockchain is high, and thus gas prices are high, more LINK will be deducted to compensate the gas the VRF has to pay to get it's random number transaction on-chain. Or if you don't want the contract to request random numbers when the gas price is high, you can specify that via the Gas Lane. The more random numbers the contract requests at once the more expensive it will be. And finally the higher the computational load of the function the consumer contract runs when recieving a random number; the more gas it will cost for the VRF to submit a random number.

The subscription model added in Chainlink VRFv2 is a powerful tool, enabling any consumer contract requesting a random number to determine how it wants that random number!

Question: (Asked on: 2022-03-09 20:02:05)
What is a gas lane in chainlink and blockchain?
URL: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/71415353/what-is-a-gas-lane-in-chainlink-and-blockchain

Question Body:


I do understand the concept of gas in the ethereum blockchain and why gas is
needed to compensate miners for providing computing power to the network.
However, when I was reading up on the chainlink vrf get a random number
documentation it says that the keyhash tells you the gas lane to use. It would
be really helpful if someone could further explain what a gas lane in
blockchain is.

Any help would be appreciated :)

(Answered on: 2022-03-10 06:17:54)


So we know that Eth gas is always subject to change and with chainlink vrf
there will be random values with your request, so you need to set a limit to
how much to spend on each request. The reason chainlink uses a Gas lane is
because the lanes are important for setting the ceiling limit of each
request... think of it as your entry into the bet.

  * Overview

New to smart contracts?

This tutorial assumes that you know how to create and deploy basic smart
contracts. If you are new to smart contract development, learn how to [Deploy
Your First Smart Contract](/getting-started/deploy-your-first-contract/)
before you start this guide.

When you connect a smart contract to real-world services or off-chain data,
you create a _hybrid smart contract_. For example, you can use Chainlink Data
Feeds to connect your smart contracts to asset pricing data like the [ETH /
USD feed](https://data.chain.link/eth-usd). These data feeds use the data
aggregated from many independent Chainlink node operators. Each price feed has
an on-chain address and functions that enable contracts to read pricing data
from that address.

The code for reading Data Feeds is the same across all EVM-compatible
blockchains and Data Feed types. You choose different types of feeds for
different uses, but the request and response format are the same.

## Examine the sample contract

This example contract obtains the latest price answer from the [BTC / USD
feed](/data-feeds/price-feeds/addresses) on the Sepolia testnet, but you can
modify it to read any of the different [Types of Data Feeds](/data-feeds#types-of-data-feeds).

  5. Because the example contract has several imports, Remix might select another contract to deploy by default. In the **Contract** section, select the `PriceConsumerV3` contract to make sure that Remix deploys the correct contract.

  6. Click **Deploy** to deploy the contract to the Sepolia testnet. MetaMask opens and asks you to confirm payment for deploying the contract. Make sure MetaMask is set to the Sepolia network before you accept the transaction. Because these transactions are on the blockchain, they are not reversible.

  7. In the MetaMask prompt, click **Confirm** to approve the transaction and spend your testnet ETH required to deploy the contract.

  8. After a few seconds, the transaction completes and your contract appears under the **Deployed Contracts** list in Remix. Click the contract dropdown to view its variables and functions.

  9. Click **getLatestPrice** to show the latest price from the aggregator contract. The latest price appears just below the button. The returned price is an integer, so it is missing its decimal point.

You can run your own oracle networks that provide data to smart contracts
similar to the `AggregatorV3Interface`, but first, you should learn how to
configure your contracts to pay oracles using LINK tokens. Follow the

}",,Two sample Solidity contracts are provided in the context information for using Chainlink VRF: `VRFv2Consumer.sol` and `VRFv2DirectFundingConsumer.sol`.,"`VRFv2Consumer.sol` contract.

  3. Configure your deployment. On the **Deploy** tab in Remix, select the **Injected Provider** environment, select the `VRFv2Consumer` contract from the contract list, and specify your `subscriptionId` so the constructor can set it.

  4. Click the **Deploy** button to deploy your contract on-chain. MetaMask opens and asks you to confirm the transaction.

  5. After you deploy your contract, copy the address from the **Deployed Contracts** list in Remix. Before you can request randomness from VRF v2, you must add this address as an approved consuming contract on your subscription account.

  6. Open the Subscription Manager at [vrf.chain.link](https://vrf.chain.link/) and click the ID of your new subscription under the **My Subscriptions** list. The subscription details page opens.

  7. Under the **Consumers** section, click **Add consumer**.

  8. Enter the address of your consuming contract that you just deployed and click **Add consumer**. MetaMask opens and asks you to confirm the transaction.

Your example contract is deployed and approved to use your subscription
balance to pay for VRF v2 requests. Next, request random values from Chainlink
VRF.

## Request random values

The deployed contract requests random values from Chainlink VRF, receives
those values, builds a struct `RequestStatus` containing them and stores the
struct in a mapping `s_requests`. Run the `requestRandomWords()` function on
your contract to start the request.

  1. Return to Remix and view your deployed contract functions in the **Deployed Contracts** list.

  2. Click the `requestRandomWords()` function to send the request for random values to Chainlink VRF. MetaMask opens and asks you to confirm the transaction. After you approve the transaction, Chainlink VRF processes your request. Chainlink VRF fulfills the request and returns the random values to your contract in a callback to the `fulfillRandomWords()` function. At this point, a new key `requestId` is added to the mapping `s_requests`.

Depending on current testnet conditions, it might take a few minutes for the
callback to return the requested random values to your contract. You can see a
list of pending requests for your subscription ID at
[vrf.chain.link](https://vrf.chain.link/).

  3. To fetch the request ID of your request, call `lastRequestId()`.

  4. After the oracle returns the random values to your contract, the mapping `s_requests` is updated: The received random values are stored in `s_requests[_requestId].randomWords`.

  5. Call `getRequestStatus()` specifying the `requestId` to display the random words.

You deployed a simple contract that can request and receive random values from
Chainlink VRF. To see more advanced examples where the contract can complete
the entire process including subscription setup and management, see the
[Programmatic Subscription](/vrf/v2/subscription/examples/programmatic-subscription) page.

Note on Requesting Randomness

Do not re-request randomness. For more information, see the [VRF Security
Considerations](/vrf/v2/security) page.

## Analyzing the contract

In this example, your MetaMask wallet is the subscription owner and you
created a consuming contract to use that subscription. The consuming contract
uses static configuration parameters.

    import

:::NEXT DOC:::

in Remix, compile the `VRFv2DirectFundingConsumer` contract.

  3. Configure your deployment. On the **Deploy** tab in Remix, select the **Injected Web3 Environment** and select the `VRFv2DirectFundingConsumer` contract from the contract list.

  4. Click the **Deploy** button to deploy your contract on-chain. MetaMask opens and asks you to confirm the transaction.

  5. After you deploy your contract, copy the address from the **Deployed Contracts** list in Remix. Before you can request randomness from VRF v2, you must fund your consuming contract with enough LINK tokens in order to request for randomness. Next, fund your contract.

## Fund Your Contract

Requests for randomness will fail unless your consuming contract has enough
LINK.

  1. [Acquire testnet LINK](/resources/acquire-link).
  2. [Fund your contract with testnet LINK](/resources/fund-your-contract). For this example, funding your contract with 2 LINK should be sufficient.

## Request random values

The deployed contract requests random values from Chainlink VRF, receives
those values, builds a struct `RequestStatus` containing them, and stores the
struct in a mapping `s_requests`. Run the `requestRandomWords()` function on
your contract to start the request.

  1. Return to Remix and view your deployed contract functions in the **Deployed Contracts** list.

  2. Click the `requestRandomWords()` function to send the request for random values to Chainlink VRF. MetaMask opens and asks you to confirm the transaction.

Set your gas limit in MetaMask

Remix IDE doesn't set the right gas limit, so you must [edit the gas limit in
MetaMask](https://support.metamask.io/hc/en-us/articles/360022895972) within
the **Advanced gas controls** settings.

For this example to work, set the gas limit to _400,000_ in MetaMask.

First, [enable **Advanced gas controls** in your MetaMask
settings](https://support.metamask.io/hc/en-us/articles/360022895972).

Before confirming your transaction in MetaMask, navigate to the screen where
you can edit the gas limit: Select **Site suggested** > **Advanced** >
**Advanced gas controls** and select **Edit** next to the **Gas limit**
amount. Update the **Gas limit** value to _400000_ and select **Save**.
Finally, confirm the transaction.

After you approve the transaction, Chainlink VRF processes your request.
Chainlink VRF fulfills the request and returns the random values to your
contract in a callback to the `fulfillRandomWords()` function. At this point,
a new key `requestId` is added to the mapping `s_requests`. Depending on
current testnet conditions, it might take a few minutes for the callback to
return the requested random values to your contract.

  3. To fetch the request ID of your request, call `lastRequestId()`.

  4. After the oracle returns the random values to your contract, the mapping `s_requests` is updated. The received random values are stored in `s_requests[_requestId].randomWords`.

  5. Call `getRequestStatus()` and specify the `requestId` to display the random words.

Do not re-request randomness. For more information, see the [VRF Security
Considerations](/vrf/v2/security) page.

  * Overview
  * Using NFT Floor Price Feeds

Chainlink NFT Floor Price Feeds provide a conservative and risk averse floor
price estimate for an NFT collection. These feeds operate the same way as
other Chainlink Data Feeds. NFT Floor Price Feeds are supported by [Coinbase
Cloud's](https://www.coinbase.com/cloud/) aggregation algorithm and
Chainlink뗩 oracle infrastructure to help eliminate extreme price outliers and
make these feeds resistant to market manipulation. You can use NFT Floor Price
Feeds for use cases that rely on high-quality NFT data, including lending and
borrowing, on-chain derivatives, dynamic NFTs, gaming guilds, CeFi products,
prediction markets, and more.

Find the list of testnet feeds on the [Contract Addresses](/data-feeds/nft-floor-price/addresses) page. To sign up for access to NFT Floor Price feeds on
Ethereum Mainnet, [use this
TypeForm](https://chainlinkcommunity.typeform.com/nft-price-feeds).

## Using NFT Floor Price Feeds

Read answers from NFT Floor Price Feeds the same way that you read other Data
Feeds. Specify the [NFT Floor Price Feed Address](/data-feeds/nft-floor-price/addresses) that you want to read instead of specifying a Price Feed
address. See the [Using Data Feeds](/data-feeds/using-data-feeds) page to
learn more.

Using Solidity, your smart contract should reference
[`AggregatorV3Interface`](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/chainlink/blob/master/contracts/src/v0.8/interfaces/AggregatorV3Interface.sol),
which defines the external functions implemented by Data Feeds.

### Golang

You can find an example with all the source files
[here](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/smart-contract-examples/tree/main/pricefeed-golang). This example uses [go-
ethereum](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum) to retrieve feed data from
the [BTC / USD
feed](https://sepolia.etherscan.io/address/0x1b44F3514812d835EB1BDB0acB33d3fA3351Ee43)
on the Sepolia testnet. To learn how to run the example, see the
[README](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/smart-contract-examples/blob/main/pricefeed-golang/README.md).

New Feed Registry

You can use the [Feed Registry](/data-feeds/feed-registry) to reference data
feed assets by name or currency identifier instead of by pair/proxy address.

## Getting a different price denomination

Chainlink Data Feeds can be used in combination to derive denominated price
pairs in other currencies.

If you require a denomination other than what is provided, you can use two
data feeds to derive the pair that you need. For example, if you needed a BTC
/ EUR price, you could take the BTC / USD feed and the EUR / USD feed and
derive BTC / EUR using division.



Important

If your contracts require Solidity versions that are `>=0.6.0 <0.8.0`, use
[OpenZeppelin's SafeMath

/*uint startedAt*/,
                /*uint timeStamp*/,
                /*uint80 answeredInRound*/
            ) = priceFeed.latestRoundData();
            return price;
        }
    }
    

The contract has the following components:

  * The `import` line imports an interface named `AggregatorV3Interface`. Interfaces define functions without their implementation, which leaves inheriting contracts to define the actual implementation themselves. In this case, `AggregatorV3Interface` defines that all v3 Aggregators have the function `latestRoundData`. You can [see the complete code](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/chainlink/blob/develop/contracts/src/v0.8/interfaces/AggregatorV3Interface.sol) for the `AggregatorV3Interface` on GitHub.

  * The `constructor() {}` initializes an interface object named `priceFeed` that uses `AggregatorV3Interface` and connects specifically to a proxy aggregator contract that is already deployed at `0x1b44F3514812d835EB1BDB0acB33d3fA3351Ee43`. The interface allows your contract to run functions on that deployed aggregator contract.

  * The `getLatestPrice()` function calls your `priceFeed` object and runs the `latestRoundData()` function. When you deploy the contract, it initializes the `priceFeed` object to point to the aggregator at `0x1b44F3514812d835EB1BDB0acB33d3fA3351Ee43`, which is the proxy address for the Sepolia BTC / USD data feed. Your contract connects to that address and executes the function. The aggregator connects with several oracle nodes and aggregates the pricing data from those nodes. The response from the aggregator includes several variables, but `getLatestPrice()` returns only the `price` variable.

## Compile, deploy, and run the contract

Configure and fund your wallet

If you have not already configured your MetaMask wallet and funded it with
testnet ETH, follow the instructions in [Deploy Your First Smart
Contract](/getting-started/deploy-your-first-contract#install-and-fund-your-metamask-wallet) to set that up. You can get testnet ETH at one of the
available [Sepolia faucets](/resources/link-token-contracts/#sepolia-testnet).

Deploy the `PriceConsumerV3` smart contract on the Sepolia testnet.

  1. [Open the example contract](https://remix.ethereum.org/#url=https://docs.chain.link/samples/PriceFeeds/PriceConsumerV3.sol) in Remix. Remix opens and shows the contents of the smart contract.

[Open the contract in
Remix](https://remix.ethereum.org/#url=https://docs.chain.link/samples/PriceFeeds/PriceConsumerV3.sol)

  2. Because the code is already written, you can start the compile step. On the left side of Remix, click the **Solidity Compiler** tab to view the compiler settings.

  3. Use the default compiler settings. Click the **Compile PriceConsumerV3.sol** button to compile the contract. Remix automatically detects the correct compiler version depending on the `pragma` that you specify in the contract. You can ignore warnings about unused local variables in this example.

  4. On the **Deploy** tab, select the **Injected Provider** environment. This contract specifically requires Web3 because it connects with another contract on the blockchain. Running in a JavaScript VM will not work.

  5. Because the example contract has several imports, Remix might select another contract to deploy by default. In the **Contract** section, select the `PriceConsumerV3` contract to make sure that Remix deploys the correct"

The code for reading Data Feeds is the same across all EVM-compatible
blockchains and Data Feed types. You choose different types of feeds for
different uses, but the request and response format are the same. To read a
feed, specify the following variables:

  * **RPC endpoint URL:** This determines which network that your smart contracts will run on. You can use a [node provider service](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/nodes-and-clients/nodes-as-a-service/) or point to your own [client](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/nodes-and-clients/). If you are using a Web3 wallet, it is already configured with the RPC endpoints for several networks and the [Remix IDE](https://remix-project.org/) will automatically detect them for you.
  * **LINK token contract address:** The address for the LINK token contract is different for each network. You can find the full list of addresses for all supported networks on the [LINK Token Contracts](/resources/link-token-contracts?parent=dataFeeds) page.
  * **Feed contract address:** This determines which data feed your smart contract will read. Contract addresses are different for each network. You can find the availble contract addresses on the following pages: 
    * [Price Feed Addresses](/data-feeds/price-feeds/addresses)
    * [Proof of Reserve Feed Addresses](/data-feeds/proof-of-reserve/addresses)
    * [NFT Floor Price Feed Addresses](/data-feeds/nft-floor-price/addresses)

The examples in this document indicate these variables, but you can modify the
examples to work on different networks and read different feeds.

This guide shows example code that reads data feeds using the following
languages:

  * On-chain consumer contracts: 
    * Solidity
    * Vyper
  * Off-chain reads using Web3 packages: 
    * Javascript with [web3.js](https://web3js.readthedocs.io/)
    * Python with [Web3.py](https://web3py.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)
    * Golang with [go-ethereum](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum)

## Reading data feeds on-chain

These code examples demonstrate how to deploy a consumer contract on-chain
that reads a data feed and stores the value.

### Solidity

To consume price data, your smart contract should reference
[`AggregatorV3Interface`](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/chainlink/blob/master/contracts/src/v0.8/interfaces/AggregatorV3Interface.sol),
which defines the external functions implemented by Data Feeds.

# Consuming Data Feeds

  * Overview

New to smart contracts?

This tutorial assumes that you know how to create and deploy basic smart
contracts. If you are new to smart contract development, learn how to [Deploy
Your First Smart Contract](/getting-started/deploy-your-first-contract/)
before you start this guide.

When you connect a smart contract to real-world services or off-chain data,
you create a _hybrid smart contract_. For example, you can use Chainlink Data
Feeds to connect your smart contracts to asset pricing data like the [ETH /
USD feed](https://data.chain.link/eth-usd). These data feeds use the data
aggregated from many independent Chainlink node operators. Each price feed has
an on-chain address and functions that enable contracts to read pricing data
from that address.

The code for reading Data Feeds is the same across all EVM-compatible
blockchains and Data Feed types. You choose different types of feeds for
different uses, but the request and response format are the same.

## Examine the sample contract

This example contract obtains the latest price answer from the [BTC / USD
feed](/data-feeds/price-feeds/addresses) on the Sepolia testnet, but you can
modify it to read any of the different [Types of Data Feeds](/data-feeds#types-of-data-feeds).

         * Address: 0x1b44F3514812d835EB1BDB0acB33d3fA3351Ee43
         */
        constructor() {
            priceFeed = AggregatorV3Interface(
                0x1b44F3514812d835EB1BDB0acB33d3fA3351Ee43
            );
        }
    
        /**
         * Returns the latest price.
         */
        function getLatestPrice() public view returns (int) {
            // prettier-ignore
            (

            ) = priceFeed.latestRoundData();
            return price;

  6. Click **Deploy** to deploy the contract to the Sepolia testnet. MetaMask opens and asks you to confirm payment for deploying the contract. Make sure MetaMask is set to the Sepolia network before you accept the transaction. Because these transactions are on the blockchain, they are not reversible.

  7. In the MetaMask prompt, click **Confirm** to approve the transaction and spend your testnet ETH required to deploy the contract.

  8. After a few seconds, the transaction completes and your contract appears under the **Deployed Contracts** list in Remix. Click the contract dropdown to view its variables and functions.

  9. Click **getLatestPrice** to show the latest price from the aggregator contract. The latest price appears just below the button. The returned price is an integer, so it is missing its decimal point.

You can run your own oracle networks that provide data to smart contracts
similar to the `AggregatorV3Interface`, but first, you should learn how to
configure your contracts to pay oracles using LINK tokens. Follow the

how.

The `latestRoundData` function returns five values representing information
about the latest price data. See the [Data Feeds API Reference](/data-feeds/api-reference) for more details.

### Vyper

To consume price data, your smart contract should import
`AggregatorV3Interface` which defines the external functions implemented by
Data Feeds. You can find it
[here](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/apeworx-starter-kit/blob/main/contracts/interfaces/AggregatorV3Interface.vy). You can find a
`PriceConsumer` example [here](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/apeworx-starter-kit/blob/main/contracts/PriceConsumer.vy). Read the _**apeworx-
starter-kit**_ [README](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/apeworx-starter-kit) to learn how to run the example.

## Reading data feeds off-chain

These code examples demonstrate how to read data feeds directly off chain
using Web3 packages for each language.

### Javascript

This example uses [web3.js](https://web3js.readthedocs.io/) to retrieve feed
data from the [BTC / USD
feed](https://sepolia.etherscan.io/address/0x1b44F3514812d835EB1BDB0acB33d3fA3351Ee43)
on the Sepolia testnet.

Talk to an expert

[Contact us](https://chain.link/contact?ref_id=Contracts) to talk to an expert
about the networks that support the LINK token.

LINK tokens are used to pay node operators for retrieving data for smart
contracts and also for deposits placed by node operators as required by
contract creators. The smallest denomination of LINK is called a Juel, and
1,000,000,000,000,000,000 (1e18) Juels are equal to 1 LINK. This is similar to
Wei, which is the [smallest denomination of
ETH](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/intro-to-ether/#denominations).

The LINK token is an ERC677 token that inherits functionality from the ERC20
token standard and allows token transfers to contain a data payload. Read more
about the [ERC677 transferAndCall token
standard](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/677).

:::caution[Understand Risks associated with Bridges] If you are using a cross-
chain bridge to transfer your LINK tokens, read the [Bridges and Associated
Risks](/resources/bridge-risks) guide to understand what cross-chain bridges
are and the risks associated with using them. :::

  * Overview
  * Bitcoin Interest Rate Curve
  * ETH Staking APR
  * Realized volatility

Chainlink rate and volatility feeds provide data for interest rates, interest
rate curves, and asset volatility. You can read these feeds the same way that
you read other Data Feeds. Specify the [Rate or Volatility Feed
Address](/data-feeds/rates-feeds/addresses) that you want to read instead of
specifying a Price Feed address. See the [Using Data Feeds](/data-feeds/using-data-feeds) page to learn more.

The following data types are available:

  * Bitcoin Interest Rate Curve
  * ETH Staking APR
  * Realized Volatility

## Bitcoin Interest Rate Curve

Lenders and borrowers use base rates to evaluate interest rate risk for
lending and borrowing contracts, asset valuation for derivatives contracts,
and an underlying rate for interest rate swap contracts. Bitcoin Interest Rate
Curve Data Feeds provide a base rate to assist with market decisions and
quantify the risks of using certain protocols and products based on current
and predicted baseline interest rates. The curve뗩 normalized methodology and
daily rates introduce more consistency and predictability to the ebb and flow
of digital asset markets. Bitcoin Interest Rate Curve Feeds incorporate a wide
range of data sources such as OTC lending desks, DeFi lending pools, and
perpetual futures markets.

To learn more about the use of these interest rate curves in the industry,
read the [Bitcoin Interest Rate Curve (CF BIRC)](https://blog.chain.link/cf-bitcoin-interest-rate-curve-cf-birc/) blog post.

See the [Rate and Volatility Feed Addresses](/data-feeds/rates-feeds/addresses) page to find the Bitcoin Interest Rate Curve feeds that are
currently available.

## ETH Staking APR

The ETH Staking APR feeds provide a trust-minimized and tamper-proof source of
truth for the global rate of return from staking as a validator to secure the
Ethereum network. The annualized rate of return is calculated over 30-day and
90-day rolling windows. Data providers use off-chain computation to calculate
returns at an epoch level, reach consensus on the APR, and then write the
results on-chain to be used by decentralized protocols and Web 3 applications.
Feeds are currently configured to update at a minimum of once per day.

See the [Rate and Volatility Feed Addresses](/data-feeds/rates-feeds/addresses) page to find the ETH Staking APR feeds that are currently
available. If you have questions or would like to request an enhancement to
ETH Staking APR feeds, contact us using [this
form](https://forms.gle/Jc1MGY5ry1ceYH1X6).

## Realized volatility

Realized volatility measures asset price movement over a specific time
interval. This value is expressed as a percent of the asset price. The more an
asset price moves up or down over time, the higher the realized volatility is
for that asset. Please note that realized volatility is not the same as
implied volatility, which measures the market뗩 expectation about future
volatility typically derived from options markets.

Each data feed reflects the volatility of an asset over a specific rolling
window of time. For example, some data feeds provide volatility data for the
last 24 hours, 7 days, and 30 days of time. You can compare the data across
these windows to infer whether the volatility of an asset is trending up or
down. For example, if realized volatility for the 24-hour window is higher
than the 7-day window, volatility might increase.

The same high-quality data providers used in Chailink뗩 price feeds sample
price data every 10 minutes to refresh volatility estimates. On-chain values
are updated when the feed heartbeat or deviation threshold is
