Why does calling an external API in chainlink not cause inconsistency?,"Because oracle responses are stored on-chain. Instead of fetching external data during the validation process, Chainlink oracle network places the data on-chain in a transaction. This ensures that all nodes go through the same validation process and reach a consensus. Having an oracle system built into a blockchain is not possible.",{'source': 'https://stackoverflow.com/questions/70130661/why-does-calling-an-external-api-in-chainlink-not-cause-inconsistency'}

How can I change the price feed token from ETH/USD to BUSD/USD using the Chainlink oracle?,"If you are trying to get BUSD/USD via a price feed on Kovan testnet, it is not available on that specific network. It is available on Ethereum mainnet however. If you are testing using the price feed, you can always use a mock contract to mock the behavior of the feeds for testing purposes only.",{'source': 'https://stackoverflow.com/questions/69298977/how-do-i-change-the-price-feed-token-from-eth-usd-to-busd-usd-with-the-chainlin'}
Why are no job runs appearing on my local Chainlink node when trying to fulfill requests?,"There are a couple of possible reasons why no job runs are appearing on your local Chainlink node. First, make sure that the external job id in the Jobs screen on the Operator UI does not contain dashes. If it does, remove the dashes when using it in the ATestnetConsumer contract. Additionally, the direct request toml may not work as is. Try appending 'allowunrestrictednetworkaccess=""true""' to the fetch section in the toml file.",{'source': 'https://stackoverflow.com/questions/72198157/no-job-show-up-in-runs-page-while-trying-to-run-a-chainlink-node-locally'}

How can I ensure that `performUpkeep` is not called again before it finishes performing work?,"In the given scenario, there is no waiting or asynchronous behavior in the EVM. One suggestion is to use the `block.number` to create an additional entry condition. This can be done by adding a requirement in the `checkUpkeep` function that checks if the current block number is greater than or equal to the last upkeep block number plus a certain value. Another option is to use OpenZeppelin's `nonReentrant` modifier to prevent reentrancy issues. These approaches can help ensure that `performUpkeep` is not called again before it finishes performing work.",{'source': 'https://stackoverflow.com/questions/69834250/is-there-a-way-to-ensure-performupkeep-isnt-called-again-before-it-finishes-per'}
Why is the value of volume always returning 0 in the Chainlink example?,"The value of volume is always returning 0 in the Chainlink example because there is an error in the code. The line `request.add(""path"", ""RAW.ETH.USD.VOLUME24HOUR"");` should be `request.add(""path"", ""RAW,ETH,USD,VOLUME24HOUR"");` (notice the commas instead of dots). Chainlink nodes 1.0.0 and later support this new ""comma based"" format. Chainlink nodes prior to 1.0.0 support the ""dots based"" format. The official docs have been updated to include this change.",{'source': 'https://stackoverflow.com/questions/71619589/chainlink-example-not-updating-value'}
Why does Chainlink VRF take a long time to get random numbers?,"Chainlink VRF follows a request and receive cycle to get a random number, which involves two transactions: the requesting transaction and the response transaction. This is necessary to look outside the blockchain and ensure randomness. The speed at which the random number is returned depends on the block time of the blockchain being used. For Ethereum, the fastest time possible is 2 times the block time, which is around 30 seconds. On faster chains like Polygon, the time is significantly lower.",{'source': 'https://stackoverflow.com/questions/68107865/chain-link-vrf-takes-a-long-time-to-get-random-numbers'}

How can I transfer NFTs using Chainlink's Automation/Keeper (checkUpkeep & performUpKeep)?,"The issue with the `upkeepNeeded` returning false is because the auction end time is set to 0. To transfer NFTs using Chainlink's Automation/Keeper, you need to ensure that the `endTime` is properly set for each auction. Make sure that the `endTime` is a valid timestamp and is greater than the current block timestamp. Additionally, check that the `listed` flag is properly set to `true` when the NFT is listed for auction. Double-check your code to ensure that these conditions are met for the automation to work correctly.",{'source': 'https://stackoverflow.com/questions/74243483/how-to-transfer-nfts-using-chainlinks-automation-keeper-checkupkeep-performu'}
Is there a way in blockchain to get the randomResult?,"No, there is no way to get the randomResult in one transaction.
