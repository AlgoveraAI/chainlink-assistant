What is Web 3.0?,https://www.chainlink.education/chainlinkIntroduction/chapter-1,"In Web 1.0, the internet was a static place where web pages and content were created and owned by a single entity (i.e., a website for the news such as the New York Times, where they curated and owned all articles). In Web 2.0, which we are currently moving away from, applications are created to allow users to create their own content on web pages. This content and the web page are still owned by a single entity (think users creating content on Facebook). These web pages are well known as “Web Apps”.

Web 2.0 isn’t a fair, equitable place for the users generating all this content and data. The centralized entities who control these web apps can and have un-equitably profited from all the content that their users  generated. Enter Web 3.0: the future of the internet we are moving towards. In Web 3.0, web apps (and the content generated within them) can be created and not be controlled by any centralized entity. These decentralized apps, or Dapps, are completely open and transparent, and can distribute any generated profits more equitably.

The future of the internet, dubbed Web 3.0, is being built in front of our eyes so let's dive in and start building the future!"
What is a contractual agreement?,https://www.chainlink.education/chainlinkIntroduction/chapter-2,"Contracts are agreements that are enforceable in a court of law. You may have signed a leasing contract to rent an apartment or house. Restaurateurs typically sign contracts with food suppliers to obtain necessary ingredients at a specific price and time no matter what happens in different food markets. You may sign an employment agreement with a company to establish your pay rate and employee benefits. In any form, once these contractual agreements have been made, they are enforced by a court of law. Any clause that is not fulfilled within a contract can be disputed and discussed within the court."
What is a digital agreement?,https://www.chainlink.education/chainlinkIntroduction/chapter-3,"Digital agreements have been the most common format of agreements in the past decade. From bank agreements to social media, to Netflix, and crypto exchanges, companies who provide services on the internet typically use digital agreements to detail the exact conditions of the service to be provided. These are called SLAs or Service Level Agreements.

What makes a digital agreement different from a regular agreement or contractual agreement? Well they’re like regular agreements….but in a digital format. These agreements can be enforced in a court of law under certain circumstances. However, this doesn’t often happen due to the costs of going to court coupled with the low value these contracts represent for individual consumers."

What is wrong with using centralized oracles?,https://www.chainlink.education/chainlinkIntroduction/chapter-5,"To create functional smart contracts we need a middleware system called an Oracle, but how will we make this Oracle? Well, we are trying to get price data into our smart contract for NFTs. My friend Jim (trust me, he is good!) is an expert in cryptocurrency prices, and he even has a server set up that we can access for price data. Awesome, we'll make Jim our oracle and he will provide price data to our NFT smart contract.

But wait….didn’t all the great properties of smart contracts and blockchains come from their decentralized nature? What if Jim wanted to maliciously send our smart contract bad price data so he could manipulate it in his favor? What if his server goes offline when the NFT needs to update and thus can’t? What if Jim isn’t even malicious but gets hacked by a malicious actor? This single oracle solution isn’t solving much of the oracle problem because it isn’t decentralized, and thus provides a weak link that ruins all of those awesome smart contract properties. You need to trust that Jim, and my word on Jim, that he is a great person and will act in the best interest of everyone. But what if we had a decentralized middleware solution, one where Jim doesn’t control everything (sorry Jim), so we didn’t have to trust him?"
When do decentralized oracle networks (DONs) Provide Data,https://www.chainlink.education/chainlinkIntroduction/chapter-5,"Chainlink allows developers to create and customize any type of Decentralized Oracle Network, or DONs, a smart contract might need. Developers can choose which nodes are a part of a network, what type of data each node is looking for, how nodes come to an agreement, when nodes should post updates, and any other computation nodes should perform. Finally, with Chainlink, developers can build smart contracts that can interact with the outside world to preserve the decentralized nature of smart contracts."
How  do decentralized oracle networks (DONs) Provide Data,https://www.chainlink.education/chainlinkIntroduction/chapter-5,"Chainlink allows developers to build and customize DONs. Chainlink allows DONs to work and assures that node operators are incentivized not to collude or act maliciously.

How does Chainlink Work?

Developers can customize several main areas of Chainlink DONs. These include:

Specifying what data DONs need to provide

How DONs retrieve data 

When DONs provide data

How agreement (also known as consensus) is achieved among the nodes to achieve a single source of truth for the specified data."
how can I take advantage of decentralized oracle networks (DONs) in my own smart contracts,https://www.chainlink.education/chainlinkIntroduction/chapter-6,"Chainlink is open source so there’s always the option of making your own DON, but creating a DON is a complex and nuanced process. Instead, in the spirit of the old developer adage “Never build something twice”, use existing DONs if possible."
