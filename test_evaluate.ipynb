However, one limitation of smart contracts is that they cannot access off-chain data (data outside of the blockchain) directly due to the blockchain's deterministic nature.\\n\\nChainlink solves this problem by providing reliable and secure bridges between smart contracts and off-chain data sources. This connection is achieved through a network of decentralized oracle nodes, which fetch and verify real-world data before delivering it to smart contracts.\\n\\nFor example, a smart contract for a decentralized weather betting application could use Chainlink to access real-world weather data. Chainlink nodes retrieve the necessary data from weather APIs and deliver it to the smart contract, which then executes based on the provided data.\\n\\nChainlink also has its own native cryptocurrency called LINK, which is used to pay for services within the ecosystem.\", 'result': 'Chainlink is a trust-minimized compute infrastructure that provides smart contracts with access to a Decentralized Oracle Network (DON) to run code in a serverless environment and fetch data from API providers.

However, one limitation of smart contracts is that they cannot access off-chain data (data outside of the blockchain) directly due to the blockchain's deterministic nature.\\n\\nChainlink solves this problem by providing reliable and secure bridges between smart contracts and off-chain data sources. This connection is achieved through a network of decentralized oracle nodes, which fetch and verify real-world data before delivering it to smart contracts.\\n\\nFor example, a smart contract for a decentralized weather betting application could use Chainlink to access real-world weather data.

When a smart contract emits a RunRequest event, this is picked up by the RunLog initiator, which then triggers a job run on the Chainlink node.\\n\\nThe RunLog initiator allows smart contracts to specify the data they want to retrieve and also helps in the preparation of data before it is sent back to the requesting contract.
