Chainlink\\noracle networks provide smart contracts with a way to reliably connect to any\\nexternal API and leverage secure off-chain computations for enabling feature-\\nrich applications. Chainlink currently secures tens of billions of dollars\\nacross DeFi, insurance, gaming, and other major industries, and offers global\\nenterprises and leading data providers a universal gateway to all blockchains.  \\n\\n## What is a blockchain oracle?\\n\\n### What is a blockchain oracle?\\n\\n[ ](https://chain.link/faqs#what-is-a-blockchain-oracle)\\n\\nA [blockchain oracle](https://chain.link/education/blockchain-oracles) is any\\nsystem that services a smart contract by providing it with data from an off-\\nchain source or connecting it with an off-chain system. Oracles enable\\nconnectivity between blockchains and real-world data by interfacing with\\nexternal APIs and data feeds, allowing them to pull data for or push data from\\na smart contract.  \\n\\n## Why do blockchains need oracles?\\n\\n### Why do blockchains need oracles?\\n\\n[ ](https://chain.link/faqs#why-do-blockchains-need-oracles)\\n\\nOracles enable smart contracts to interact with off-chain resources. Without\\noracles, smart contracts can only access data within a blockchain, severely\\nlimiting their potential applications. The majority of industry-changing\\n[real-world use cases](https://blog.chain.link/smart-contract-use-cases/) for\\nsmart contracts require off-chain data and computation for proper execution\\nand often an integration with existing payment rails to settle a contract. For\\nexample, a smart contract may require high-quality weather data from a\\nreputable source like AccuWeather to trigger a transaction. It may also\\nrequire the ability to pay out escrowed fiat currency through existing\\nfinancial infrastructure, such as a bank checking account.  \\n\\n## What is \"real-world data\"?\\n\\n### What is \"real-world data\"?\\n\\n[ ](https://chain.link/faqs#what-is-real-world-data)\\n\\nReal-world data, also known as off-chain data or external data, refers to the\\ncurrent global data infrastructure that exists outside of the blockchain that\\nmust be brought on-chain via oracles to be used by smart contract\\napplications. Like a computer without the Internet, blockchain-based smart\\ncontracts have inherent value on their own, such as creating and swapping\\ntokens. However, they become exponentially more powerful when externally\\nconnected to the vast and accelerating [data and API\\neconomy](https://blog.chain.link/understanding-how-data-and-apis-power-next-\\ngeneration-economies/) taking root outside the blockchain ecosystem.  \\n\\n## What is the oracle problem?\\n\\n### What is the oracle problem?\\n\\n[ ](https://chain.link/faqs#what-is-the-oracle-problem)\\n\\nThe [oracle problem](https://blog.chain.link/what-is-the-blockchain-oracle-\\nproblem/), also known as the “smart contract connectivity problem”, refers to\\na blockchain’s inability to natively pull data from or push data to any\\nexternal [off-chain system](https://chain.link/education-hub/oracle-\\ncomputation) due to the strong security properties created by a blockchain’s\\nconsensus mechanism.\\n\\nBlockchain nodes are designed to perform standardized and uniform operations\\nto generate consensus on a set of transactions (solving the double-spend\\nproblem). However, they are not suited to answer subjective questions about\\nprobabilistic real-world data, as blockchain nodes do not always have access\\nto the same information, making generating consensus on even the most basic\\ndata requests challenging and source quality enforcement impossible. It is for\\nthis reason blockchains focus on generating definitive truth about the\\nvalidity of transactions, but limit connections to any off-chain systems to\\nensure the network always remains live and produces deterministic results for\\nincoming transactions.\\n\\nIn order to create a bridge between the blockchain (on-chain) and the outside\\nworld (off-chain), an additional and separate piece of infrastructure known as\\nan “oracle” is required. However, the use of a centralized oracle can result\\nin manipulated data inputs and outputs, meaning the oracle mechanism itself\\nneeds to be highly decentralized to ensure the security of a smart contract’s\\nexecution is maintained end-to-end.\\n\\n## What is the Chainlink Network?\\n\\n### What is the Chainlink Network?\\n\\n[ ](https://chain.link/faqs#what-is-the-chainlink-network)\\n\\nThe Chainlink Network refers to all of the decentralized oracle networks\\nactively operating using the Chainlink protocol, including individual oracles,\\n[data providers running their own node](https://blog.chain.link/easily-sell-\\nyour-apis-and-data-to-any-blockchain-via-chainlink/), and [node\\noperators.](https://blog.chain.link/what-is-a-chainlink-node-operator/) By\\nenabling smart contracts to quickly and securely connect to off-chain data\\nsources using decentralized oracle networks, the Chainlink Network helps\\ndevelopers build more robust and diverse blockchain applications using real-\\nworld inputs and outputs. Additionally, as middleware between low-level\\nblockchain protocols and external, off-chain data sources, the Chainlink\\nNetwork serves as an abstraction layer for data providers to easily sell their\\nexisting APIs to any blockchain network.  \\n\\n## What is a decentralized oracle network?\\n\\n### What is a decentralized oracle network?\\n\\n[ ](https://chain.link/faqs#what-is-a-decentralized-oracle-network)\\n\\nA decentralized oracle network consists of multiple blockchain oracles run by\\nindependent node operators that are chosen to retrieve and validate data from\\nseveral different off-chain sources. Each of the oracles’ responses within a\\ndecentralized oracle network are aggregated together to form a single trusted\\ndata point, which can be used to trigger [smart\\ncontracts](https://chain.link/education/smart-contracts) on any blockchain and\\nreally any system that needs highly reliable data that’s provably accurate.\\nThe data delivered on-chain can be hosted in a Reference Contract (pull\\nmodel), and/or delivered directly to consuming smart contracts (push model).\\n\\nThe Chainlink Network is made up of multiple decentralized oracle networks\\nrunning simultaneously and independently of one another. For example, if a\\nsmart contract requires data about the [price of\\nETH/USD](https://data.chain.link/ethereum/mainnet/crypto-usd/eth-usd), instead\\nof relying on one individual blockchain oracle to pull price data from one API\\nsource, the smart contract can use a decentralized oracle network to have\\nmultiple oracle nodes pull data from several different API sources and then\\naggregate the result.\\n\\nThrough decentralized computation, Chainlink-powered decentralized oracle\\nnetworks provide users superior security and reliability guarantees on the\\ninputs and outputs of their smart contract, ensuring that both on-chain and\\noff-chain components of a decentralized application are tamper-proof end-to-\\nend.  \\n\\n## What is a node operator?\\n\\n### What is a node operator?\\n\\n[ ](https://chain.link/faqs#what-is-a-node-operator)\\n\\nNode operators are the entities that maintain and run the blockchain oracles\\nthat make up each Chainlink oracle network providing smart contracts on\\nvarious blockchains access to external data and resources. These operators\\nconsist of professional validators for various blockchain networks, teams of\\nhighly experienced DevOps engineers, and leading organizations such as\\n[Accuweather](https://www.accuweather.com/en/press/chainlink-and-accuweather-\\nto-bring-world-class-weather-data-on-to-blockchains/994046), the [Associated\\nPress](https://www.ap.org/press-releases/2021/ap-chainlink-to-bring-trusted-\\ndata-onto-leading-blockchains), and [Deutsche Telekom\\nMMS](https://www.t-systems-mms.com/en/company/newsroom/detail-eng/t-systems-\\nmultimedia-solutions-becomes-chainlink-node-operator.html) that focus\\nspecifically on building infrastructure for the Chainlink ecosystem.\\nAdditionally, external data vendors and API providers can monetize their data\\nsets by running a Chainlink Node and providing signed data directly to smart\\ncontracts. Node operators are able to configure their blockchain oracle node\\nto connect to any off-chain data source and on-chain blockchain environment,\\nproviding a high degree of flexibility.\\n\\nNode operators within the Chainlink Network strictly adhere to the best\\nsecurity practices and use external monitoring systems to ensure a secure and\\nreliable operation is maintained around the clock. Third-party marketplaces\\nlike [market.link](https://market.link/) provide users insight into the\\ncurrent and historical performance of each individual node operator.\\nAdditionally, anybody can become a Chainlink node operator and immediately\\nbegin providing smart contracts access to off-chain data. If you are\\ninterested in running a node, please navigate to our\\n[documentation](https://docs.chain.link/docs/running-a-chainlink-node).\\n\\n## What is Transaction Value Enabled (TVE)?\\n\\n### What is Transaction Value Enabled (TVE)?\\n\\n[ ](https://chain.link/faqs#what-is-transaction-value-enabled-tve)\\n\\nTransaction Value Enabled (TVE) is a cumulative flow metric that measures the\\naggregate monetary value of transactions facilitated by a protocol over a\\ngiven time period. Chainlink TVE is measured as the total US dollar volume of\\ntransactions enabled by Chainlink oracles, specifically every transaction\\nwhere a Chainlink Price Feed reference contract was called across 11\\nblockchains that have integrated Chainlink (Avalanche, BNB Chain, Ethereum,\\nFantom, Gnosis Chain, HECO Chain, Metis, Moonbeam, Moonriver, Optimism, and\\nPolygon). TVE is calculated across millions of transactions using on-chain\\ndata and resolved across thousands of token prices.\\n\\nTVE measures both volume and facilitated flow, capturing not only input and\\noutput values but also how a protocol is used within transactions to\\nfacilitate value securely. Chainlink TVE encompasses a wide variety of\\ntransactions and movements within transactions that require Chainlink oracles\\nfor accurate price updates, including trading, lending, rebalancing, automated\\nyield farming, stablecoin minting, and many more DeFi use cases.\\n\\n## Why choose Chainlink to aggregate data for a smart contract rather than\\nbuilding one’s own oracle?\\n\\n### Why choose Chainlink to aggregate data for a smart contract rather than\\nbuilding one’s own oracle?\\n\\n[ ](https://chain.link/faqs#why-choose-chainlink-to-aggregate-data-for-a-\\nsmart-contract-rather-than-building-ones-own-oracle)\\n\\nChainlink provides users with a simple to integrate and [pre-built\\ndecentralized oracle solution](https://chain.link/data-feeds) that can be\\nutilized today by any smart contract on any blockchain. A Chainlink\\nintegration allows developers to focus on their application’s core business\\nlogic without needing to allocate precious resources to rebuilding\\ninfrastructure. Rolling your own oracle is extremely difficult and\\nprobabilistic as the oracle problem is complicated, technical, nuanced, and\\nrequires constant monitoring, upkeep, funding, and resources to maintain\\nproperly.\\n\\nThe ability to easily integrate a project with Chainlink’s decentralized\\noracle network has enabled numerous teams to avoid the hassle of building\\ntheir own oracle, allowing them to instead focus on innovating and building\\nuse cases. Additionally, as Chainlink users collectively fund oracle networks\\nas a public good, the costs of using Chainlink are far lower than attempting\\nto build and manage your own solution. For example, a [growing\\nlist](https://data.chain.link/) of DeFi applications now use and collectively\\nfund Chainlink Price Feeds. If you are interested in integrating with\\nChainlink, please [reach out](https://chain.link/contact?ref_id=faq).\\n\\n## Who participates in the Chainlink network?\\n\\n### Who participates in the Chainlink network?\\n\\n[ ](https://chain.link/faqs#who-participates-in-the-chainlink-network)\\n\\nThe [Chainlink ecosystem](http://www.chainlinkecosystem.com/ecosystem)\\nincludes hundreds of dApps, blockchains, node operators, and data providers,\\nas well as an expansive research and open-source development community. The\\nChainlink Network powers the leading DeFi applications including\\n[Aave](https://aave.com/), [Synthetix](https://www.synthetix.io/), and\\n[Compound](https://compound.finance/), securing billions of dollars in user\\nfunds. As Chainlink is a permissionless framework for building oracles,\\nanybody can join the network at any time and immediately start contributing to\\nthe growing ecosystem. See the [Chainlink Data\\nFeeds](https://data.chain.link/) page for a more in-depth list of users,\\nsponsors, and node operators.  \\n\\n## What is Chainlink’s economic model?\\n\\n### What is Chainlink’s economic model?\\n\\n[ ](https://chain.link/faqs#what-is-chainlinks-economic-model)\\n\\nChainlink’s economic model revolves around the use of the LINK token to pay\\nfor the operation of a wide variety of oracle services in demand by smart\\ncontract developers and Web2 systems, as well as around using LINK as a\\ncryptoeconomic mechanism for incentivizing the correct performance of oracle\\nservices and providing user assurances.\\n\\nThe supply side of Chainlink economics involves launching new oracle services\\nand continually optimizing existing ones to further the adoption of\\nChainlinked smart contracts and trust-minimized Web2 systems with the aim of\\ncapturing new fee opportunities. It also includes continually provisioning\\nhigher security guarantees on oracle services through staking and other\\nsecurity assurances to enable more advanced and higher-value smart contracts\\nto exist.\\n\\nOn the demand side, users pay node operators in LINK to access oracle\\nservices. Node operators and community members will also be able to stake LINK\\nin the future as a form of service-level guarantee around oracle node\\nperformance, providing a powerful incentive and penalty mechanism for\\nChainlink nodes to generate accurate and timely oracle reports. Continued\\nChainlink adoption incentivizes oracle nodes to compete for growing user fees\\nfrom Chainlinked dApps. This competition encourages oracle nodes to strengthen\\ntheir reputation and increase their LINK stake, showcasing their commitment to\\nhonest behavior and maximizing the cost of attack for malicious actors.\\nIncreased stake can also drive increased opportunities for nodes to earn user\\nfees from Chainlinked dApps since they are viewed as having greater incentive\\nto perform jobs in a timely and accurate manner.\\n\\nWithin Chainlink’s economic model, the increased availability and adoption of\\noracle services cultivates more fee opportunities for node operators who\\nsupport the protocol. This creates a virtuous cycle in which oracle networks\\ncan sustain themselves on user fees alone by providing new trust-minimized\\nservices, increasing security guarantees, and capturing new fee opportunities\\nfrom growing adoption.\\n\\nFor more information on Chainlink economics, see the following resources:\\n\\n  * [Chainlink Staking: Long-Term Goals, Roadmap, and Initial Implementation](https://blog.chain.link/chainlink-staking-roadmap/)\\n  * [Chainlink Economics 2.0 and the Market for Trust-Minimized Apps | Sergey Nazarov](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KSS8Gk5UxE4)\\n  * [The Security Impact Curve and Future Fee Opportunity in Chainlink Oracle Networks](https://blog.chain.link/understanding-the-security-impact-curve-and-future-fee-opportunity/)\\n  * [The Chainlink 2.0 Whitepaper](https://chain.link/whitepaper)\\n\\n## What makes the Chainlink oracle network more reliable than other oracle\\nnetworks?\\n\\n### What makes the Chainlink oracle network more reliable than other oracle\\nnetworks?\\n\\n[ ](https://chain.link/faqs#what-makes-the-chainlink-oracle-network-more-\\nreliable-than-other-oracle-networks)\\n\\nThe Chainlink Network is composed of the highest-quality, Sybil-resistant\\noracle nodes that are operated by leading DevOps and security teams, such as\\nDeutsche Telekom MMS, who have decades of experience running mission-critical\\ninfrastructure. The security-reviewed and tamper-resistant nodes that comprise\\nChainlink [oracle networks](https://data.chain.link/) are highly transparent:\\nTheir performance metadata is made publicly available to users and can be\\nfound on-chain or on third-party sites such as\\n[market.link](http://market.link/).\\n\\nChainlink also employs a defense in depth approach where multiple security\\nsolutions are used in combination to increase oracle network robustness and\\nreliability. This includes privacy-preserving cryptography like\\n[DECO](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWTx1iQOCDM), trusted hardware such as\\n[Town Crier](https://blog.chain.link/town-crier-and-chainlink/),\\ncryptoeconomic security through implicit/explicit staking, and much more.\\n\\n## How decentralized is the Chainlink Network?\\n\\n### How decentralized is the Chainlink Network?\\n\\n[ ](https://chain.link/faqs#how-decentralized-is-the-chainlink-network)\\n\\nThe Chainlink Network consists of hundreds of professionally-operated and\\ncommunity-run [nodes](https://blog.chain.link/what-is-a-chainlink-node-\\noperator/), allowing for the creation of numerous Sybil-resistant and tamper-\\nproof oracle networks that can scale up in decentralization as the value being\\nsecured rises. Chainlink nodes are operated by professional DevOps and\\nsecurity teams with decades of experience operating mission-critical\\ninfrastructure and are already securing tens of billions of dollars of value\\nacross multiple blockchain networks. The performance data about each Chainlink\\nnode can be found on-chain or on independent sites such as\\n[market.link](http://market.link/).  \\n\\n## How are Chainlink services updated?\\n\\n### How are Chainlink services updated?\\n\\n[ ](https://chain.link/faqs#how-are-chainlink-services-updated)\\n\\nIn order to meet user demand and continuously improve performance, Chainlink\\nservices are updated from time to time to introduce new features and\\nfunctionalities. Additionally, due to the dynamic nature of off-chain\\nenvironments, swift updates may also be required in response to various\\nexternalities. Examples may include, but are not limited to, token migrations,\\nprotocol rebrands, extreme market events, and upstream issues with data or\\nnode operations.\\n\\nIn alignment with software development best practices, updates can encompass\\noff-chain and/or on-chain processes as Chainlink services are composed of both\\non-chain smart contract logic and off-chain infrastructure such as the\\nChainlink node client and data provider end-points.\\n\\nOff-chain updates commonly take place at the node operator level, where each\\nindividual operator manages their own Chainlink node configuration. Updates\\ncan include upgrading to a new Chainlink node software version to improve\\nperformance or changing API endpoints in a job specification if a data\\nprovider becomes unreliable. Off-chain updates can also take place at the data\\nprovider level, such as responding to a token migration event or other\\nexternalities.\\n\\nOn-chain updates take place at the smart contract level, where a [multi-\\nsignature safe](https://docs.gnosis-safe.io/introduction/the-programmable-\\naccount/gnosis-safe) (multisig) is used to modify on-chain parameters relating\\nto a Chainlink service. This can include replacing faulty nodes on a specific\\noracle network, introducing new features such as [Off-Chain\\nReporting](https://docs.chain.link/docs/off-chain-reporting/), or resolving a\\nsmart contract logic error. The multisig-coordinated upgradability of\\nChainlink services involves time-tested processes that balance collusion-\\nresistance with the flexibility required to implement improvements and adjust\\nparameters.\\n\\nSpecifically, the use of a multisig to modify the on-chain parameters of\\nChainlink services allows for a safe, secure, and rapid response to black swan\\nevents and other potential incidents on the order of minutes, minimizing\\nservice interruption for users. Alternative methods to incident response that\\ndon’t utilize a multisig can introduce severe risk to users. For instance,\\noracle services with immutable on-chain logic require a full contract\\nredeployment if any on-chain parameter requires modification. This can delay\\nincident response times, introduces significant coordination friction, and\\nnecessitates additional actions from users who may not respond in a timely\\nenough manner.\\n\\nMoreover, Chainlink is a generalized and modular protocol that enables oracle\\nnetworks to be customized to meet the exact requirements of users.

The\\nresearchers working on the Chainlink protocol are industry experts in\\nblockchain oracles and are responsible for some of the most innovative\\ndevelopments in the space, such as\\n[DECO](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1909.00938.pdf),\\n[VRF](https://blog.chain.link/chainlink-vrf-on-chain-verifiable-randomness/),\\n[Mixicles](https://chain.link/mixicles.pdf), [Town\\nCrier](https://eprint.iacr.org/2016/168.pdf), and more.\\n\\n## How does the Chainlink Network access high-quality data?\\n\\n### How does the Chainlink Network access high-quality data?\\n\\n[ ](https://chain.link/faqs#how-does-the-chainlink-network-access-high-\\nquality-data)\\n\\nChainlink nodes can access any authenticated or premium data source API\\nthrough the use of modular [external\\nadapters](https://docs.chain.link/docs/external-adapters). External adapters\\ncan be written in any programming language and hosted as a serverless function\\non any cloud provider or web server. These adapters allow Chainlink nodes to\\naccess a wide array of data sources, including authenticated and private APIs\\nthat require sensitive password keys, such as enterprise backends and\\nsubscription-based sources. Thus, Chainlink nodes have a high degree of\\nflexibility as API credentials can be kept off-chain and stored securely,\\nseparate from the node itself.  \\n\\n## What are the benefits of having multiple layers of data aggregation?\\n\\n### What are the benefits of having multiple layers of data aggregation?\\n\\n[ ](https://chain.link/faqs#what-are-the-benefits-of-having-multiple-layers-\\nof-data-aggregation)\\n\\nChainlink oracle networks operate using multiple layers of data aggregation to\\nensure there is no single point of failure or any reliance on a single source\\nof truth that could be corrupted. This redundancy is not only required to\\nensure high-value smart contracts consume highly refined data, but also to\\nensure [Chainlink Price Feeds](https://data.chain.link/) provide full market\\ncoverage that reflects the true market price of assets. With Price Feeds\\nsecuring tens of billions in user funds, these layers of aggregation secure\\nthe DeFi ecosystem.\\n\\n _Chainlink uses multiple layers of aggregation to ensure broad market\\ncoverage and data quality._\\n\\n  \\n\\nThe first aggregation layer is at the data source level where professional\\ndata aggregation firms (e.g. BraveNewCoin, CoinGecko) fetch market data from\\nhundreds of exchanges, taking into account volume and liquidity differences,\\nand generate a single weighted reference price point. The second aggregation\\nlayer is at the node operator level where each individual Chainlink oracle\\nnode sources price data from multiple data aggregation firms and takes the\\nmedian, mitigating outliers, API downtime, and ensuring nodes do not rely on\\nany one source. The third aggregation layer is at the oracle network level\\nwhere the responses from multiple oracle nodes are aggregated by taking the\\nmedian, ensuring no individual node has control over the resulting data point\\ndelivered to contracts. All of this together ensures smart contracts consume\\nonly the highest quality data that reflects the true market-wide price.  \\n\\nFor more information on secure oracle design, refer to our articles on [the\\nimportance of data quality for DeFi smart\\ncontracts](https://blog.chain.link/the-importance-of-data-quality-for-defi/)\\nand [the three levels of data aggregation in Chainlink Price\\nFeeds.](https://blog.chain.link/levels-of-data-aggregation-in-chainlink-price-\\nfeeds/)  \\n\\n## Where can I explore the performance and reliability of the Chainlink\\nNetwork?\\n\\n### Where can I explore the performance and reliability of the Chainlink\\nNetwork?\\n\\n[ ](https://chain.link/faqs#where-can-i-explore-the-performance-and-\\nreliability-of-the-chainlink-network)\\n\\nThe [Chainlink Price Feeds page](https://data.chain.link/) provides real-time\\nvisualizations of each decentralized price feed that provides on-chain\\nexchange rates for cryptocurrencies, stablecoins, commodities, and indices.\\nUsers can explore each individual price feed, which offers transparency around\\nwhich nodes power each feed, each node’s latest response, how often feed\\nupdates occur, the gas price paid by each node, the users sponsoring each\\nfeed, and hyperlinks to on-chain transactions.\\n\\nLinkPool’s [market.link ](https://market.link/)is a permissionless marketplace\\nthat allows node operators to display their historical performance and list\\nwhat oracle services they offer. Users can use this data to filter and analyze\\neach node’s revenue, gas costs, and response times. Developers can also query\\nthe Chainlink Market’s [Metrics\\nAPI](https://docs.linkpool.io/docs/market_metrics_api_overview) to access all\\nof this raw data themselves and build their own analysis framework using real-\\ntime data regarding the performance of the Chainlink Network.\\n\\n## How will Chainlink scale?\\n\\n### How will Chainlink scale?\\n\\n[ ](https://chain.link/faqs#how-will-chainlink-scale)\\n\\nThrough off-chain reporting and [threshold\\nsignatures](https://blog.chain.link/threshold-signatures-in-chainlink/),\\nChainlink oracle networks can scale to thousands of secure nodes within a\\nnetwork. Instead of each node making their own on-chain transaction for each\\nupdate, node responses are aggregated off-chain, and only a single transaction\\nneeds to be submitted on-chain. The security of data is cryptographically\\nmaintained throughout the entire process. This allows for the creation of\\nChainlink oracle networks that are highly decentralized while remaining cost-\\nefficient and secure against manipulation through a defense in depth approach.\\nAdditionally, unlike other oracle projects, each Chainlink oracle network is\\nentirely independent of one another and does not affect the scalability or\\nthroughput of any other Chainlink Network.  \\n\\n## What is Chainlink Off-Chain Reporting (OCR)?\\n\\n### What is Chainlink Off-Chain Reporting (OCR)?\\n\\n[ ](https://chain.link/faqs#what-is-chainlink-off-chain-reporting-ocr)\\n\\n[Off-Chain Reporting (OCR)](https://docs.chain.link/docs/off-chain-reporting/)\\nis the third and latest version of the Chainlink Core software client run by\\nChainlink nodes, which significantly improves the efficiency of how data is\\naggregated by Chainlink oracles. OCR reduces operating costs by up to 90% and\\nenables the Chainlink Network to generate a 10x increase in the amount of\\nsecure, real-world data available to smart contract applications.\\n\\nOCR allows Chainlink nodes to communicate off-chain and aggregate data at zero\\ngas costs using a distributed, peer-to-peer network. In OCR’s computation\\nmodel, each node fetches data from one or multiple data sources, signs it with\\ntheir unique private key, and broadcasts it to the rest of the oracle network\\noff-chain. Once a sufficient number of responses have been generated, a single\\ntransaction is transmitted on-chain containing every node’s observation. The\\noracle report and node signatures are then validated on-chain by a smart\\ncontract, providing the transparency and end-to-end security guarantees that\\nare fundamental to Chainlink oracle networks.\\n\\nAll Chainlink nodes operating in-production run the OCR and FluxMonitor\\nclients in parallel to achieve multi-client diversity and security through\\nredundancy.

Rather than\\nneeding centralized entities to facilitate the movement of financial markets,\\nusers can access, trade, and lend assets using open-source software running on\\ndecentralized networks. The result is self-running, peer-to-peer financial\\nmarkets based on transparency, open access, and data-driven automation.\\n\\nChainlink oracle networks enable tamper-resistant and sustainable [price\\nfeeds](https://chain.link/data-feeds) that are currently in use by several top\\nDeFi applications to secure billions of dollars worth of locked value. By\\nenabling smart contracts to access new forms of data as inputs, while\\nretaining the underlying security and reliability guarantees of the smart\\ncontract, Chainlink plays a crucial role in the DeFi industry’s growth.\\n\\nIn the current price reference feed model, independent nodes in the Chainlink\\nNetwork monitor for price changes off-chain, trigger an update when the price\\nchange hits a defined threshold (e.g. 1%), fetch aggregated market prices from\\nhigh-quality data providers, and then aggregate node responses to generate a\\nhighly available and manipulation-resistant price update on-chain. Smart\\ncontracts can then access an extremely accurate price using a simple function\\ncall.\\n\\nSome examples of price feed users include:\\n\\n  * Synthetic asset platforms that require the price of real-world assets in order to mint their representation on-chain. These platforms use Chainlink [reference contracts](https://docs.chain.link/docs/using-chainlink-reference-contracts/) to create tokens tied to real-world assets, such as gold, indices, or even car loans.\\n  * Lending and borrowing platforms that require a price feed to ensure the total value of the collateral. These platforms use Chainlink to issue and settle loans, liquidate collateral, and calculate interest payments.\\n  * [Stablecoins](https://chain.link/education-hub/stablecoins) that require a price feed to assert the value of the underlying collateral backing the asset. These platforms use Chainlink to create stablecoins pegged to fiat currency, currency baskets, or commodities.\\n  * Asset management platforms that require a reliable price feed for the critical rebalancing of asset ratios. These platforms use Chainlink to power a [decentralized exchange (DEX)](https://chain.link/education-hub/what-is-decentralized-exchange-dex), adjust capital pools, or facilitate multiple forms of payment.\\n\\nExplore the expansive collection of Chainlink Price Feeds:\\n[data.chain.link](https://data.chain.link/)\\n\\n## Chainlink Updates\\n\\n### Chainlink Updates\\n\\n[ ](https://chain.link/faqs#chainlink-updates)\\n\\n## How can I stay up-to-date with official Chainlink news?\\n\\n### How can I stay up-to-date with official Chainlink news?\\n\\n[ ](https://chain.link/faqs#how-can-i-stay-up-to-date-with-official-chainlink-\\nnews)\\n\\nChainlink has a variety of active channels where you can find more information\\nabout the latest Chainlink announcements, discover helpful technical\\nresources, and connect with other members of our rapidly growing community.\\nBelow is a list of official Chainlink channels.
